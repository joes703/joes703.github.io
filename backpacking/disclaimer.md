# Trip Expectations and Personal Responsibility

Backpacking in the wilderness comes with real risks. Each person on this trip is responsible for their own safety, decisions, and preparation. As *Galatians 6:5* reminds us, “each one will carry his own load.” You are expected to know your limits, stay within them, and be able to navigate the route on your own. You should also know how to set up your shelter, stay warm and dry, and carry gear appropriate for the terrain and weather. General guidance will be provided, but your kit is your responsibility. As *Proverbs 22:3* says, “the shrewd one sees the danger and conceals himself.” Preparing wisely helps prevent avoidable problems. If anything is unclear, please ask questions before the trip.

This is not a guided trip. We will look out for each other, but the group depends on every person doing their part. *Philippians 2:4* encourages us to “look out not only for your own interests, but also for the interests of others.” That includes staying in contact at trail junctions, during breaks, and at camp. Speak up early if you are struggling. Unpreparedness, poor communication, or pushing beyond your abilities can affect everyone’s safety.

If someone is seriously injured and needs help, we will do our best to assist. I carry a satellite communicator and will use it to contact emergency services if needed. This is a last resort. Response may be delayed based on conditions, and it should not be relied on in place of solid preparation.

Unexpected problems may occur. Accidents, weather shifts, and hard choices can happen without warning. In an emergency, we may have to act quickly with limited information. While we will act in good faith, we are not medical professionals and cannot guarantee outcomes. *Proverbs 11:14* reminds us that “there is success through many advisers.” Speak up, ask questions, and help contribute to safe group decisions.

By joining this trip, you agree to take full responsibility for your own safety, gear, and readiness. That includes preparing ahead of time, making thoughtful decisions, and contributing to a safe and respectful group experience.
