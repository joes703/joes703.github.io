# Gear Selection Advice

This section helps you make smart, lightweight gear choices—whether you’re buying, borrowing, or upgrading. It’s based on real-world Sierra conditions and what experienced hikers actually use.

You don’t need perfect gear. You need reliable, tested gear that fits your needs and doesn't weigh more than it has to.

## Pack

### What to Look For
- Fits your torso and hips properly (get measured!)
- 45–60L capacity for multi-day trips
- Internal frame and padded hip belt
- Can fit a bear canister (inside or under lid)
- External pockets: mesh front, side bottles, hip belt storage

### Avoid
- Over 4–5 lbs unless you're carrying extreme loads
- Cramming a bear can into an underbuilt pack
- Frameless packs unless you're under 10 lb base weight

### Top Picks

## Shelter

### What to Look For
- 1–3 lbs packed weight
- Storm-worthy and ventilated (especially at high elevations)
- Easy to pitch and confidence-inspiring
- Fits *you* and your pad comfortably

### Avoid

- Single-wall shelters with poor airflow
- Sketchy trekking pole tents if you haven’t practiced

### Top Picks

## Clothing

### What to Look For
- One set of hiking clothes + one set of sleep clothes
- Lightweight layers that dry fast and manage moisture
- Simple, intentional layering system (sun, insulation, rain)

### Avoid

- Bringing backups “just in case”
- Overpacking—clothes are where beginners add pounds fast

### Core Kit

**Hiking Layer (worn all day)**:
- Long-sleeve sun shirt (synthetic or merino)
- Shorts or pants (personal preference)
- Merino or synthetic underwear + socks
- Buff and sun hat or cap

**Camp & Sleep Layer**:

- One pair of dry socks (for sleep)
- Insulated jacket (down or synthetic)
- Beanie + gloves for high-elevation mornings

**Weather Protection**:
- Rain jacket – Always bring, even in summer
- Wind pants or rain pants (optional)
- Umbrella (optional for sun or rain)

### Pro Tips
- You’ll wear the same hiking clothes every day. That’s normal.
- Keep sleep clothes clean and dry. Never hike in them.

## Footwear

### What to Look For
- Trail runners: lightweight, breathable, fast drying
- Wide toe box for foot swelling
- Solid grip and cushioning for rocky trails

- Smartphone with preloaded offline maps (Avenza, CalTopo, etc.)

## Toiletries

### What to Look For
- Minimal kit focused on hygiene, not comfort
- Soap for handwashing at camp (not just sanitizer)
- Lightweight storage in a ziplock or pouch

### Avoid
- Full-size items, deodorant, bulky extras
- Face wash, “trail shampoo,” or scented stuff
- Relying on wipes alone

### Core Kit
- Compact toothbrush (or trimmed)

- Dental floss
- Unscented soap (dropper bottle or soap sheets)
- Small hand sanitizer (1 oz)
- Toilet paper or wipes
- Trowel (small and light)
- Lip balm with SPF
- Optional: compact mirror, nail clippers

### Pro Tips
- Wash hands with soap before meals. Sanitizer isn’t enough at camp.
- Label your TP trash bag if you’re in a group.
- Wipe down at camp (face, feet, pits, groin). You’ll feel way better.

## First Aid

### What to Look For
- Compact kit based on what you’ll actually use
- Focus on blisters, cuts, pain, and common gut issues
- Add your own meds and tape

### Avoid

- Tweezers, scissors, safety pin
- Nitrile gloves (1 pair)

### Pro Tips
- Tape hot spots at the first sign of rubbing.
- Don’t carry what you don’t know how to use.
- Serious injuries = evac. Your kit is for small stuff only.

## What Not to Buy

### Skip This Stuff
- Cotton clothing – Cold, heavy, and slow to dry
- Cheap “bundle” gear kits – Usually heavy and poorly made
- Sleeping bags without tested ratings
- Heavy multitools, big knives, or hatchets
- Straw filters – Inefficient for groups or camp use
- Big lanterns or multi-battery flashlights
- Too many stuff sacks – Adds clutter and weight
- Solar panels – Ineffective on most trips
- Waterproof pack covers – Use a pack liner instead
- Heavy camp shoes – Go foam or go without

### Pro Tips
- Ask before you buy. Someone probably has one you can try or borrow.
- If it seems made for car camping, it probably is.
