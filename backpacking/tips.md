# Backpacking Tips

**1. Know why you're going**  
Backpacking is hard work, so know why you’re doing it. You’ll carry extra weight over long miles, often at high altitude where the air is thin. Days can bring intense sun, and nights can turn cold. Having a goal makes the effort worthwhile. Whether it’s solitude, standing on a peak, walking through alpine forests, fishing a quiet lake, or camping beneath the stars, everyone should have a reason that makes the work rewarding. Without one, you’ll spend the trip wondering why you’re out there.  

**2. Preparation starts long before a trip**  
Make a plan for everything. Get in shape early and train with a loaded pack to build stamina. Research the conditions (elevation, season, temperature, and forecast) to choose gear suited to them. Give yourself time to test your equipment before the trip: pitch your shelter, light your stove, check your pad for leaks, and confirm your water filter works. Practice setting up your shelter on your own. Organize early with a complete gear checklist.  

**3. Lighter pack, happy life**  
The weight you carry can make or break your trip. You carry everything that keeps you alive, but carrying too much can work against you. Every unnecessary ounce costs energy and limits how far or comfortably you can go. A lighter pack is one of the best improvements you can make to your backpacking experience. Weighing your gear is the first step to knowing where to cut weight. For most four-day trips, total pack weights around 20–25 pounds are common. If you’re above 30 pounds, you’re probably carrying more than you need. Use your gear list to track what you bring, how much it weighs, and identify what you can remove or replace. When reducing weight, start by eliminating what you don’t need before upgrading to lighter versions. Avoid packing for every “what if,” but keep backups for critical items like water treatment or navigation.  

**4. Be a smart hiker**  
Start hiking early when temperatures are cooler. Morning miles are easier than hiking under the afternoon sun. Find a steady pace and stick with it; moving too fast tires people out and makes it easy to miss the scenery you came to see. Know where you are and where you’re going. You should be able to read a map and navigate on your own if separated. Watch for changes in weather, like dark clouds building or wind picking up. Rain is manageable, but being on an exposed ridge during a thunderstorm is dangerous. If you feel hot spots, chafing, or pack discomfort, stop and fix them before they turn into injuries. If you’re hiking in a group, be aware of others. Some people enjoy conversation, while others prefer quiet. Notice how those around you are doing and adjust your pace if needed. Give people space when they need it, and speak up if someone seems to be struggling. A good hiking partner pays attention and helps keep the group balanced. Stay together unless everyone agrees to separate and is confident navigating on their own.  

**5. Camp well, sleep well**  
Choose your campsite with care. Avoid dead trees, low drainages, or exposed ridges where wind and water can cause problems. Look for firm, slightly sloped ground with wind protection and good drainage. When you arrive, set up your shelter first and secure it before doing anything else. Clear sharp rocks or sticks, then ventilate the shelter to reduce condensation overnight. Filter water for dinner and the next morning as soon as you reach camp. Change into dry clothes and keep your sleep layers clean and separate. Cook on bare ground away from your shelter, and dispose of wastewater at least 200 feet from lakes or streams. Store all food and scented items in a bear canister or Ursack well away from camp. Before leaving, scan the site for trash and gear. Leave it cleaner than you found it.  

**6. Eat and drink more than you think you need**  
Choose food that fuels long effort, not quick bursts. Most of your energy on trail comes from fat and complex carbohydrates, so build your meals around them. High-fat foods like nuts, nut butter, cheese, and coconut powder pack the most calories for their weight. Oats, rice, and tortillas provide steady fuel without the sugar crashes common with candy and energy bars. Aim for roughly 2,500–3,500 calories a day, knowing you will likely burn more than you eat.  
Start every morning with breakfast to restore energy reserves. Eat small amounts often through the day instead of waiting for large meals. Include some protein with carbs to help recovery. When you stop for the day, eat or drink something with both carbs and protein within half an hour to help your body repair.  
Drink when you are thirsty and replace the salt you lose. On hot, long, or high-altitude days, add electrolytes or lightly salt your food. “Cameling up” at a water stop is fine if you keep electrolytes balanced, but drinking excessive plain water can be harmful. Carry a small electrolyte mix or rehydration packet as backup.  

**7. Good hygiene prevents most illnesses on the trail**  
Wash your hands with soap before eating and after using the bathroom; sanitizer alone is not enough. Wipe down your body each evening to remove sweat, sunscreen, and grit so your skin stays healthy and your sleep system clean.  
Take care of your feet. Wash or wipe them daily, change socks when they get wet, and air them out during breaks. Treat hot spots as soon as you feel them to prevent blisters. Trim toenails short before the trip to avoid bruising or loss on long descents.  
Carry a small first aid kit with only the basics: wound care, pain relief, and digestive medicine.  

**8. Be safe. Avoid unnecessary risks**  
Most serious backpacking accidents result from falls, drowning, hypothermia, and wildlife encounters. Move carefully on uneven or wet terrain, and use trekking poles to maintain balance. Cross streams only where the water is slow and shallow; unbuckle your pack, face upstream, and turn back if conditions look unsafe. Stay dry to prevent hypothermia. Change into warm layers before you’re cold and keep your insulation protected from rain. Keep your food safe from wildlife at all times. Do not touch, feed, approach, or interfere with animals.  

**9. Respect the wilderness**  
Follow [Leave No Trace](https://lnt.org/why/7-principles/) principles and local regulations designed to protect the backcountry. Camp on durable surfaces like established sites or rock, never on fragile vegetation. Stay at least 200 feet from lakes and streams when washing, bathing, or going to the bathroom. Strain and scatter dishwater away from camp, and never wash dishes directly in lakes or streams. Pack out all trash, food waste, and used toilet paper. Leave what you find, minimize campfire impact, and keep noise low so others and wildlife can enjoy the area undisturbed. Always leave the place better than you found it.
