# Backpacking Tips

These tips are meant to be read as guidance. They reflect habits, decisions, and skills that tend to make backpacking trips safer, lighter, and more enjoyable.

**1. Prepare early**  
Start training your body early and often. Train with a loaded pack to get used to the fit and feel of the pack. Well ahead of a trip, you should inspect and test all of your gear so you have time to repair or replace anything that fails. Practice setting up your shelter often until you can do it quickly and correctly. Using a checklist will help you stay organized and avoid forgetting to bring anything.

**2. Pack light**  
A few extra ounces in clothing, cookware, or backup gear can quickly turn into pounds. Weigh your gear and record the weights to identify your heaviest items. Remove what you don’t need before spending money to upgrade what you do. Bring only what you need to stay safe and maintain a reasonable level of comfort. If you need help, ask an experienced backpacker to review your gear list and suggest where you can cut weight.

**3. Be a smart hiker**  
Know where you are and where you are headed, and be able to navigate on your own if separated. Watch for changing weather, such as building clouds or increasing wind, and avoid exposed terrain when storms are possible. Rain alone is manageable, but lightning on exposed terrain is not. Address hot spots, chafing, or pack discomfort as soon as you notice them to prevent bigger problems later. If you are hiking in a group, stay aware of others. Notice how those around you are doing and adjust when needed. Speak up if you or someone else is struggling. Stay together unless everyone agrees to separate and can navigate independently.

**4. Camp well, sleep well**  
Choose your campsite with care. Avoid dead trees, low drainages, and exposed ridges where wind and water can create issues. Look for firm ground with natural wind protection and good drainage. When you arrive, set up and secure your shelter first. Clear sharp debris and ventilate the shelter to reduce condensation overnight. Filter water for dinner and the next morning as soon as you reach camp. Change into dry clothes if you got wet. Cook away from your shelter and store all food and scented items securely. Before leaving, check the site for trash and forgotten gear.

**5. Eat and hydrate well**  
Choose food that supports long effort, not short bursts. Most on-trail energy comes from fat and complex carbohydrates, so plan meals around them. Expect to burn more calories than you eat and plan accordingly. Eat regularly through the day to maintain energy and support recovery. Include some protein with carbs to help your body repair after hiking. Drink when you are thirsty and replace the salt you lose using electrolytes.

**6. Hygiene and foot care**  
Wash your hands with soap before eating and after using the bathroom; sanitizer alone is not enough. Wipe down your body each evening to remove sweat, sunscreen, and grit. Take care of your feet. Wash or wipe them daily, change socks when they get wet, and air them out during breaks. Treat hot spots as soon as you feel them to prevent blisters. Trim toenails before the trip to avoid bruising or loss on long descents. Carry a small first aid kit with the basics for minor injuries and common issues.

**7. Avoid unnecessary risks**  
Most serious backpacking accidents result from falls, drowning, hypothermia, and wildlife encounters. Move carefully on uneven or wet terrain and slow down when conditions deteriorate. Cross streams only where the water is slow and shallow, and turn back if conditions look unsafe. Prevent hypothermia by staying dry and warm. Change into insulating layers before you are cold and protect them from rain. Keep food secured to avoid wildlife encounters, and never touch, feed, approach, or interfere with animals.

**8. Respect the wilderness**  
Follow [Leave No Trace](https://lnt.org/why/7-principles/) principles and local regulations designed to protect the backcountry. Camp on durable surfaces such as established sites or rock, not fragile vegetation. Stay at least 200 feet from lakes and streams when washing, bathing, or using the bathroom. Strain and scatter dishwater away from camp, and never wash dishes directly in lakes or streams. Pack out all trash, food waste, and used toilet paper. Leave what you find, minimize campfire impact, and keep noise low so others can enjoy the area.

**9. Skills every backpacker should learn**
1. Navigation. Learn to read maps, determine your location, and navigate using a map and compass.
2. Energy and nutrition management. Understand how fat, carbs, calories, salt, and fluids affect energy, endurance, and recovery.
3. Weather awareness. Recognize signs of changing weather and understand its impact on the trail and at camp.
4. Campsite selection. Learn how to choose sites that avoid hazards like dead trees, flooding, wind exposure, and heavy bug pressure.
5. First aid. Learn how to prevent and treat blisters and care for wounds. Take a course to learn CPR, respond to choking, and stabilize an injured person until help arrives.
6. Basic knots. Learn some basic knots for shelters, repairs, and securing gear.
7. Improvised rain shelter. Learn how to set up a tarp or poncho as a temporary shelter during rain when you are away from camp.
