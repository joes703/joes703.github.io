# Backpacking Tips

## Why Go Backpacking

Backpacking is hard work. It’s long climbs, heavy packs, heat, bugs, and weather that doesn’t care about your plans. But it’s also quiet mornings, clear lakes, and the satisfaction of earning every view. Go because you find that kind of work rewarding, not because friends are going or it sounds fun. When you know why you’re out there, the effort feels worth it and every trip becomes more meaningful.

## Tips

These tips reflect what keeps our trips safe and enjoyable year after year. They’re written for anyone who wants to stay safe, travel light, and make good decisions in the backcountry, whether it’s your first overnight or your fiftieth.

### Be Prepared

- **Get organized early.**  
  Start planning your trip well ahead of time, especially the first one of the season. Use a checklist so nothing gets left behind, and give yourself time to replace or repair gear before you need it.

- **Preparation prevents problems.**  
  Most problems start before the trail, from untested gear, poor planning, or skipped training. Test critical gear (shelter, stove, pad, and water filter) ahead of time in case something needs to be repaired or replaced.

- **Get in shape for the trip.**  
  Backpacking takes effort. Train early and build fitness so climbs, descents, and elevation feel manageable instead of punishing.  

- **Know the conditions.**  
  In the Sierra, you’ll often get rain and thunderstorms, strong sun, cold nights, and mosquitoes in the same trip. Be ready for all of it.

### Be Light

- **The weight you carry affects your trip.**  
  Every extra ounce costs effort and energy. A lighter pack is one of the best improvements you can make to your backpacking. Weighing your gear is the first step to knowing where to cut weight. For most 4-day trips, total pack weights around 20–25 lb are common, and if you’re above 30 lb, you’re probably carrying more than you need.

- **Eliminate before you upgrade.**  
  Simplifying is better than upgrading. Leave behind what you don’t need before buying lighter versions of what you do. 

- **Fear adds weight.**  
  Packing for every “what if” makes your load heavier than it needs to be. It's ok to bring a backup for critical items such as water treatment, navigation, or spare socks.  

### Be Aware

- **Pay attention to the weather.**  
  Watch for changing wind, clouds, or temperature drops so you can react before a storm builds.

- **Know where you are and where you’re going.**
  Always be able to navigate on your own. Check the map often enough that you could find your way if separated from the group.

- **Take care of small problems early.**  
  Hot spots become blisters and damp clothes become cold fast. Fix small issues as soon as you notice them.

- **Choose safe campsites.**  
  Avoid setting up under dead branches, in low areas that collect water, or on exposed ridges. 

### Be Respectful

- **Be considerate of others.**  
  Everyone’s safety and enjoyment depend on good communication and cooperation. When we look out for each other, everyone has a better trip.

- **Take care of the places you visit.**  
  Follow local rules and Leave No Trace principles. Camp on durable surfaces, pack out trash, and keep campsites cleaner than you found them. Pack out all paper waste and stay away from water sources when washing or using the bathroom.
