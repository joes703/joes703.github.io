# Backpacking Tips

This is an opinionated guide to hiking and camping in the Sierra Nevada and similar mountains. It offers clear, practical tips to help you prepare, stay safe, and enjoy your time out there.

## 1. Required Reading

If you are new to backpacking, I strongly recommend you read through these before going on a trip. 

- REI's [Intro to Backpacking](https://www.rei.com/learn/series/intro-to-backpacking) is one of the best guides out there. If you are a new backpacker, please read each one of the articles in that series. 
- After reading that series, take a look at the REI [Ultralight Backpacking Basics](https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/ultralight-backpacking.html) for tips on reducing the weight of your pack by choosing lightweight gear and doing without some non essential items. 
- If you're going backpacking in the mountains of California, you're hiking in "bear country." Familiarize yourself with the tips found in [Backpacking in Bear Country](https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/backpacking-in-bear-country.html).
- [Leave No Trace principles](https://lnt.org/why/7-principles/)

## 2. What You’re Responsible For

- Know and follow wilderness regulations.
- Secure all food and trash to protect your trip and the wildlife.
- Follow Leave No Trace principles.
- Speak up early if you’re cold, hurt, or struggling.
- Learn the route and be able to navigate on their own.

## 3. Preparation and Testing Before You Go

Before the trip, make sure you know how to:

- Set up and take down your shelter in any conditions
- Use your water filter properly and check it for leaks or clogs
- Stay warm and dry using your sleep system
- Navigate with a map and compass or GPS

Also test and prep:

- Set up your shelter fully and check all stakes, guylines, and anchors
- Boil water with your stove and confirm how much fuel you need
- Run water through your filter at home to verify flow
- Load your pack and do a short hike to check comfort and fit
- (Optional) Treat clothing with permethrin to reduce mosquito bites

## 4. Packing Light

- Make a packing list ahead of time. Don’t guess the night before.
- Use [Lighterpack](https://lighterpack.com) to log weights and spot unnecessary items.
- Start with what you need to stay warm, dry, fed, and safe. Cut from there.
- Don’t pack your fears. Most “just in case” items add weight and rarely get used.
- Aim to keep your total pack weight under 30 lbs, including food, water, and fuel.
- A lighter pack means faster hiking, less fatigue, and more room for comfort items if you want them.

## 5. What to Eat

- Stick to boil-only meals. Skip anything that needs simmering or actual cooking.
- Freeze-dried meals are lighter and last longer than dehydrated ones.
- Backpacking is typically a low to moderate intensity activity, with bursts of higher exertion during climbs or at elevation.
  - Fat is your most efficient fuel — over twice the calories per gram as carbs or protein.
  - Sugary snacks provide quick energy but often cause crashes. Balance with fat and protein.
  - Aim for a food mix of about 50–55% carbs, 30–35% fat, and 10–15% protein.
  - Target 125–140 calories per ounce for weight-efficient energy.

## 6. Conditions and How to Handle Them

Backpacking the Sierra in summer means strong sun, cold nights, sudden storms, and mosquitoes — often in the same day. Knowing what to expect and how to prepare makes all the difference.

### Sun and Heat

- UV exposure is intense at altitude. Wear long sleeves, pants, sunglasses, and a wide-brimmed hat.
- Choose breathable, fast-drying fabrics like wool or synthetic. Avoid cotton.
- Sip water steadily and use electrolytes when sweating heavily.

### Cold and Night

- Night temps often drop into the 30s. Bring a 30°F-rated sleep system and warm layers.
- A fleece or active insulation layer is for hiking. A puffy is for camp.
- Sleep in dry socks and a base layer top. Don’t rely on your hiking clothes staying dry.

### Rain and Wind

- Thunderstorms are common in the afternoon. Be off ridges and passes by early afternoon.
- Always carry a rain shell. Even short storms can lead to cold stress.
- Wind can hit fast. Camp in sheltered spots and pitch your shelter low and tight.

### Bugs

- Mosquitoes are active June through mid-August, especially near water at dusk.
- Treat clothes with permethrin before the trip.
- Use picaridin lotion on exposed skin. It’s effective and gear-safe.
- A head net helps in camp.

### Foot Care and Footwear

- Rocky trails and long descents are standard. Trail runners or boots both work — just make sure they fit and dry quickly.
- Trim toenails to prevent black nails and pressure blisters.
- Bring two pairs of socks. Rotate daily and dry them during breaks.
- Use heel lock lacing to reduce sliding, blisters, and toe bang.


## 7. Campsite Selection and Shelter Setup
Practical campsite criteria, plus how to set up a storm-worthy shelter.

- Look for flat, durable ground with some wind protection
- Avoid dips, slopes, and signs of pooling water
- Stay at least 200 feet from water and trails
- Check above for dead branches or leaning trees ("widowmakers")
- Clear sharp rocks, sticks, and pinecones before pitching

## 8. Hygiene

- Wash hands often. Hand hygiene is the #1 way to prevent getting sick.
- Consider a nightly wipe down of your body to stay clean.
- Bring a sealable bag and pack out all used toilet paper or wipes.

## 9. First Aid

- Carry the medications you personally need. Forgetting a daily med can end your trip.
- Bring a few pain relievers — they help with soreness, injuries, and unexpected aches.
- Digestive issues are common. A couple Imodium or antacids can save the day.
- Treat blisters early. Leukotape or moleskin work well if applied before they get worse.
- Clean and cover small cuts to prevent infection. Don’t ignore them just because they’re minor.

## 10. Water Strategy and Filter Use

- Always treat your water. Clear streams can still carry Giardia.
- Use separate containers for dirty and clean water to avoid contamination.
- Camel up at water sources by drinking a full liter before hiking on.
- Let silty water settle before filtering to prevent clogs.
- If freezing temps are expected, keep your filter inside your sleep setup. A frozen filter is no longer safe.

## 11. Sierra-Specific Hazards

The Sierra presents unique risks even in summer. Know what to expect and how to respond.

- Sun: Intense UV at elevation. Wear long sleeves, a hat, and sunglasses.
- Altitude: Symptoms like headache and nausea can hit above 8,000 ft. Ascend gradually, hydrate, and rest if needed.
- Dehydration: Drink steadily throughout the day. Don’t rely on thirst.
- Storms: Thunderstorms build quickly. Be off exposed ridges by early afternoon.
- Cold: Nights can drop below freezing. Sleep in dry clothes and have sufficient insulation.
- Falls: Stay on trail. Avoid scrambling or climbing unless absolutely necessary. Rock in the Sierra can be loose or slick.
- 
## 12. Common Leave No Trace Mistakes

- Dropping small bits of trash like wrappers or bottle caps.
- Burning trash or food in fire pits.
- Leaving food waste behind. Scraps, peels, shells, and crumbs don’t break down and attract animals.
- Leaving food or smelly items unattended, even briefly.
- Leaving toilet paper or wipes buried or exposed. Pack them out.

When on the trail
- Don’t hike far ahead or fall far behind without saying something
- Wait at trail junctions if you’re unsure where the group went
- Speak up if you’re tired, overheated, cold, or unsure — early is best

When setting up camp
- Avoid dips or depressions. Even dry ground can flood during a storm.
- Always check above your shelter site — avoid dead trees and loose branches.
