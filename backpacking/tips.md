## Why Go Backpacking

Backpacking is hard work. It’s long climbs, heavy packs, heat, bugs, and weather that doesn’t care about your plans. But it’s also quiet mornings, clear lakes, and the satisfaction of earning every view. Go because you find that kind of work rewarding, not because friends are going or it sounds fun. When you know why you’re out there, the effort feels worth it and every trip becomes more meaningful.

## Tips

These tips reflect what keeps our trips safe and enjoyable year after year. They’re written for anyone who wants to stay safe, travel light, and make good decisions in the backcountry, whether it’s your first overnight or your fiftieth.

### Be Prepared

- **Get organized early.**  
  Start planning your trip well ahead of time, especially the first one of the season. Use a checklist so nothing gets left behind, and give yourself time to replace or repair gear before you need it.

- **Preparation prevents problems.**  
  Most problems start before the trail, from untested gear, poor planning, or skipped training. Test critical gear (shelter, stove, pad, and water filter) ahead of time in case something needs to be repaired or replaced.

- **Get in shape for the trip.**  
  Backpacking takes effort. Train early and build fitness so climbs, descents, and elevation feel manageable instead of punishing.  

- **Know the weather.**  
  Check the forecast before you go and pack for changing conditions, not just what you hope to get. Bring enough to stay warm and dry if it rains.  

### Be Light

- **The weight you carry shapes your trip.**  
  Every extra pound costs effort and energy. A lighter pack makes hiking easier and camp life simpler, but balance matters more than chasing numbers. Weighing your gear is the first step to knowing if you need to lighten your load. 

- **Eliminate before you upgrade.**  
  Simplifying is better than upgrading. Leave behind what you don’t need before buying lighter versions of what you do. 

- **Fear adds weight.**  
  Packing for every “what if” makes your load heavier than it needs to be. It's ok to bring a backup for critical items such as water treatment, navigation, or spare socks.  

### Be Aware

- **Pay attention to the weather.**  
  Watch for changing wind, clouds, or temperature drops so you can react before a storm builds.

- **Take care of small problems early.**  
  Hot spots become blisters and damp clothes become cold fast. Fix small issues as soon as you notice them.

- **Choose safe campsites.**  
  Avoid setting up under dead branches, in low areas that collect water, or on exposed ridges. 

- **Stay ahead of hydration and salt.**  
  You lose more water and electrolytes on trail than you think. Drink steadily and replace salt throughout the day to avoid fatigue or cramps.

### Be Respectful

- **Be considerate of others.**  
  Everyone’s safety and enjoyment depend on good communication and cooperation. When we look out for each other, everyone has a better trip.

- **Take care of the places you visit.**  
  Follow local rules and Leave No Trace principles. Camp on durable surfaces, pack out trash, and keep campsites cleaner than you found them. Pack out all paper waste and stay away from water sources when washing or using the bathroom.
