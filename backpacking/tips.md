## Tips

These tips reflect what keeps our trips safe and enjoyable year after year. They’re written for anyone who wants to stay safe, travel light, and make good decisions in the backcountry — whether it’s your first overnight or your fiftieth.

## Before the Trip

### Be Prepared

- Get organized early. Start planning your trip well ahead of time, especially the first one of the season. Use a checklist so nothing gets left behind, and give yourself time to replace or repair gear before you need it.  
- Preparation prevents problems. Most problems start before the trail — from untested gear, poor planning, or skipped training. Check and test your gear (shelter, stove, pad, and water filter) ahead of time in case something needs to be repaired or replaced. Practice setting up your shelter and adjusting it.  
- Get in shape for the trip. Backpacking takes effort. Train early and build fitness so climbs, descents, and elevation feel manageable instead of punishing.  
- Know the conditions. In the Sierra, you’ll often get rain and thunderstorms, strong sun, cold nights, and mosquitoes in the same trip. Be ready for all of it.  
- Be self-sufficient. Be confident setting up your own shelter, filtering water, and navigating. Everyone should be able to manage their own basic needs on trail.  

### Pack Light

- The weight you carry affects your trip. Every extra ounce costs effort and energy. A lighter pack is one of the best improvements you can make to your backpacking experience. Weighing your gear is the first step to knowing where to cut weight. For most 4-day trips, total pack weights around 20–25 lb are common. If you’re above 30 lb, you’re probably carrying more than you need.  
- Eliminate before you upgrade. Simplifying is better than upgrading. Leave behind what you don’t need before buying lighter versions of what you do.  
- Fear adds weight. Packing for every “what if” makes your load heavier than it needs to be. It’s okay to bring a backup for critical items such as water treatment, navigation, or spare socks.  
- Pack efficiently. Heavier items ride best close to your back and centered. Keep snacks, water, map, and rain gear accessible.  
- Protect your sleep system. Use a waterproof liner or trash compactor bag inside your pack to keep insulation and dry clothes safe from rain.

## On the Trail

- Start hiking early. Mornings are cooler, and you’ll have time to reach camp before afternoon storms.  
- Know where you are and where you’re going. Check the map often enough that you could find your way if separated from the group.  
- Pay attention to the weather. Watch for changing wind, clouds, or temperature drops so you can react before a storm builds. Rain isn’t a bad thing, but staying wet is.  
- Handle problems early. A small blister or damp shirt can turn into a bigger issue fast. Stop and fix it before continuing.

## At Camp

- Choose a safe campsite. Avoid setting up under dead branches, in low areas that collect water, or on exposed ridges. Look for flat ground, good drainage, and wind protection.  
- Set up your shelter first. Clear sharp rocks and sticks before laying down your tent or groundsheet, and keep it ventilated overnight to prevent condensation.  
- Stay clean and comfortable. Wipe down your body before bed to stay comfortable and keep your sleeping bag clean.  
- Protect your gear and food. Change into dry clothes at camp, air out damp items when the sun’s out, and store food in a bear canister or Ursack at least 100 feet from your sleeping area.  
- Cook safely. Cook on stable ground and keep flames clear of shelters. Dispose of waste water 200 feet from lakes and streams.  
- Lighting. Headlamps are more useful than flashlights — they keep both hands free.  
- Respect the wilderness. Follow local rules and [Leave No Trace principles](https://lnt.org/why/7-principles/). Camp on durable surfaces, pack out trash, and keep campsites cleaner than you found them. Never wash dishes in lakes or streams.

## Hygiene and Health

- Wash with soap before eating and after using the bathroom. Antibacterial gel alone isn’t enough.  
- Dig catholes 6–8 inches deep, 200 feet from water, trail, and camp. Pack out all toilet paper and hygiene products. Dog waste bags work well for this.  
- Take care of your feet. Wash or wipe them daily, air them out at lunch, and treat hot spots early. Leukotape-K works well to prevent blisters.  
- Keep your first-aid kit simple — treat blisters, cuts, headaches, and stomach issues.  
- Bring your personal medications in labeled containers.  
- Sleep with inhalers or any medication you may need overnight.

## Food and Cooking

- Choose food you actually enjoy eating on trail, not just calorie-dense options.  
- Plan about 2,500–3,500 calories per day.  
- Balance carbs for quick energy with fats and protein for endurance.  
- Separate food by day for easier rationing.  
- Add electrolytes to your water if hiking in heat or at high elevation.  
- Test-boil your stove before the trip to estimate how much fuel you’ll need.  
- Simple, boil-only meals save time and require less fuel.  
- Never leave food unattended, even briefly. Store all food and scented items securely in bear-safe containers where required.

## Clothing and Layering

- Treat hiking clothes with permethrin before mosquito season.  
- Wear merino wool or synthetics instead of cotton — they dry much faster.  
- Keep clean sleep clothes in a dry bag for comfort.  
- Bring gloves and a warm hat if temps will dip into the 40s.  
- Carry extra socks in case a pair gets wet.

## What to Pack

This is a simple list of the type of gear you’ll need.  

> Backpacking gear is not the same as camping gear. Tents, sleeping bags, and cookware designed for backpacking are much lighter and more compact than car-camping equipment. Do not bring heavy or oversized gear that isn’t meant to be carried for miles.

**Shelter and Sleep**  
- Tent, tarp, or hammock with rain protection (include stakes and guylines)  
- Sleeping bag or quilt rated for the lowest expected temperature  
- Sleeping pad for insulation and comfort  
- Optional: footprint or pillow  

**Clothing and Footwear**  
- Quick-drying hiking shirt and pants or shorts  
- Lightweight insulating layer (fleece or puffy)  
- Rain jacket and rain protection for pack  
- Hat, sunglasses, and sun protection  
- Extra socks and underwear  
- Optional: gloves, beanie, or sleep clothes  
- Trail runners or hiking boots, depending on terrain  
- Trekking poles (strongly recommended)  

**Cooking and Food**  
- Isobutane stove and fuel (110 g for 3–4 nights solo, 230 g for longer trips)  
- Pot (600–900 mL), spoon, and lighter or matches  
- Simple meals that require only boiling water  
- Snacks and electrolytes for the trail  
- Bear canister or Ursack (required in most Sierra areas)  
- Food storage bag and trash bag  
- Biodegradable soap and small hand towel  

**Water**  
- Filter or purifier with backup (tabs or drops)  
- Two to three liters of total water capacity (bottles or soft flasks)  
- Collect from flowing sources when possible  

**Navigation and Safety**  
- Map and compass  
- GPS watch or offline navigation app  
- Satellite messenger or personal locator beacon (optional but recommended)  
- Headlamp with fresh batteries  
- First-aid kit with blister care and tape  
- Small repair kit (cord, patch tape, multitool, safety pin)  
- Whistle  

**Personal and Hygiene**  
- Toothbrush and small toothpaste  
- Hand sanitizer and unscented wipes  
- Trowel and sealable bag for toilet paper (must be packed out)  
- Sunscreen, insect repellent, and lip balm  
- Quick-dry cloth or small towel  
- Personal medications

## Gear Selection Advice

**Pack**  
Choose a pack that fits your torso and hips properly — get measured to confirm. Look for a 45–60 L capacity, an internal frame, and a supportive hip belt. It should fit a bear canister inside or under the lid and have useful external pockets for water bottles and small items. Avoid packs heavier than 4–5 lb unless carrying very heavy loads. Frameless designs only work well if your total base weight is under 10 lb.

**Shelter**  
Pick a shelter in the 1–3 lb range that handles wind and rain well and pitches easily. Ensure it fits both you and your pad comfortably, and practice setting it up before your trip. Freestanding tents are easiest to use, while trekking-pole shelters save weight but require more skill. In storms, use all guylines and keep vents open to reduce condensation.

**Sleep System**  
For Sierra summer trips, a 20–30°F bag or quilt paired with a pad rated R-4.0 or higher provides reliable warmth. Down insulation offers the best weight-to-warmth ratio and compressibility; synthetic is cheaper and more forgiving when damp. Keep your bag and sleep clothes dry in a waterproof liner.

**Cook System**  
A simple upright canister stove and one pot (600–900 mL) are ideal for most backpackers. Titanium pots are lighter; aluminum spreads heat better for simmering. One pot, one utensil, and one lighter are all you need. Canister stoves work reliably in the Sierra and are allowed where alcohol or wood stoves are banned. Avoid multi-pot kits or frying pans unless cooking for a group.

**Food Storage**  
Most Sierra routes require a bear canister. Choose a model approved for your destination and sized for your trip. Clear plastic is easiest to use; carbon-fiber saves weight. Where canisters aren’t required, an Ursack can work if tied securely to a solid anchor. Keep it closed tightly and lined with odor-proof bags. Store canisters at least 100 ft from camp and away from cliffs or water.

**Water Filtration**  
A squeeze-type filter is the simplest and most reliable choice. Pair it with a 2–3 L dirty water bag and at least 1 L of clean storage. Test your setup before the trip. CNOC Vecto bags remain a top choice for quick collection. Always carry a few Micropur or chlorine dioxide tablets as backup.

**Clothing**  
Bring one hiking outfit and one clean, dry sleep set. Use lightweight layers that dry quickly and cover three needs: sun, insulation, and weather protection. Avoid cotton and redundant items.  
Hiking clothes should include a long-sleeve sun shirt, shorts or breathable pants, underwear, and hiking socks. Merino resists odor and insulates when damp; synthetics dry faster and last longer.  
For camp, pack a base layer, dry socks, and an insulated jacket (down or synthetic). Add a beanie and light gloves for cool mornings. Always carry a rain jacket, and treat clothing with permethrin for mosquito season.

**Footwear**  
Trail runners work best for most Sierra conditions — they’re light, breathable, and dry quickly. Look for a roomy toe box and solid grip for rocky terrain. Avoid waterproof models in summer; they trap heat and moisture. Break shoes in before the trip, and use lightweight gaiters to keep debris out. Address any discomfort immediately to prevent blisters.

**Electronics**  
Keep electronics simple. A rechargeable headlamp, a 10,000 mAh battery bank, and a phone with offline maps are enough for most trips. Use airplane mode and lower brightness to save power. Avoid solar panels unless camping in open sun for long periods. Keep devices in waterproof bags and warm at night in freezing temps.

**Hygiene**  
Keep your hygiene kit minimal — focus on real cleanliness, not comfort extras.  
Include a small toothbrush and toothpaste tabs, soap sheets or a few drops of unscented soap, hand sanitizer, wipes or toilet paper, lip balm, and a lightweight trowel. Avoid scented products or bulky toiletries.

**First Aid**  
Carry a small, functional kit — only what you know how to use. Include Leukotape or blister pads, bandages, gauze, and pain and stomach meds (ibuprofen, acetaminophen, Imodium, Pepto). Add tweezers, scissors, and personal prescriptions. Skip pre-made “survival” kits filled with items you’ll never use. Review and restock your kit before every trip.
