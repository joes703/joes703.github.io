# Backpacking Tips

**1. Know why you're going**  
Backpacking is demanding work, so knowing why you’re out there matters. You’re carrying everything that keeps you alive, and that weight over long miles at altitude where the air is thin can test your limits. A clear goal guides every decision you make, from the route you plan to what you pack and how far you push. Whether it’s solitude, standing on a peak, walking through forests, fishing a quiet lake, or camping beneath the stars, having a reason to be there makes the effort meaningful instead of just hard.

**2. Preparation starts long before a trip**  
Train with a loaded pack to get used to the pack and hiking with weight. Research the conditions, including season, elevation, and forecast, to bring the right gear. Test critical items early so you have time to repair or replace anything that fails. Practice setting up your shelter until you can do it smoothly on your own. Use a checklist to stay organized and avoid forgetting anything important.

**3. Lighter pack, happy life**  
Most people don’t realize how quickly weight accumulates until they feel it on a long uphill climb at high elevation. A few extra ounces in clothing, cookware, or backup gear can quickly turn into pounds you’ll regret carrying. Weigh your gear and record the weights in your list so you can see where it all goes. Remove what you don’t need before spending money to upgrade what you do. If your pack weighs more than thirty pounds for a short trip, you’re probably carrying comfort items that cost more energy than they’re worth. Bring what you need to stay safe and maintain a reasonable level of comfort, but don’t pack for every fear or “what if.”

**4. Be a smart hiker**  
Start hiking early when temperatures are cooler. Morning miles are easier than hiking under the afternoon sun. Find a steady pace and stick with it; moving too fast tires people out and makes it easy to miss the scenery you came to see. Know where you are and where you’re going. You should be able to read a map and navigate on your own if separated. Watch for changes in weather, like dark clouds building or wind picking up. Rain is manageable, but being on an exposed ridge during a thunderstorm is dangerous. If you feel hot spots, chafing, or pack discomfort, stop and fix them before they turn into injuries. If you’re hiking in a group, be aware of others. Some people enjoy conversation, while others prefer quiet. Notice how those around you are doing and adjust your pace if needed. Give people space when they need it, and speak up if someone seems to be struggling. A good hiking partner pays attention and helps keep the group balanced. Stay together unless everyone agrees to separate and is confident navigating on their own.  

**5. Camp well, sleep well**  
Choose your campsite with care. Avoid dead trees, low drainages, or exposed ridges where wind and water can cause problems. Look for firm, slightly sloped ground with wind protection and good drainage. When you arrive, set up your shelter first and secure it before doing anything else. Clear sharp rocks or sticks, then ventilate the shelter to reduce condensation overnight. Filter water for dinner and the next morning as soon as you reach camp. Change into dry clothes and keep your sleep layers clean and separate. Cook on bare ground away from your shelter, and dispose of wastewater at least 200 feet from lakes or streams. Store all food and scented items in a bear canister or Ursack well away from camp. Before leaving, scan the site for trash and gear. Leave it cleaner than you found it.  

**6. Eat and drink more than you think you need**  
Choose food that fuels long effort, not quick bursts. Most of your energy on trail comes from fat and complex carbohydrates, so build your meals around them. High-fat foods like nuts, nut butter, cheese, and coconut powder pack the most calories for their weight. Oats, rice, and tortillas provide steady fuel without the sugar crashes common with candy and energy bars. Aim for roughly 2,500–3,500 calories a day, knowing you will likely burn more than you eat.  
Start every morning with breakfast to restore energy reserves. Eat small amounts often through the day instead of waiting for large meals. Include some protein with carbs to help recovery. When you stop for the day, eat or drink something with both carbs and protein within half an hour to help your body repair.  
Drink when you are thirsty and replace the salt you lose. On hot, long, or high-altitude days, add electrolytes or lightly salt your food. “Cameling up” at a water stop is fine if you keep electrolytes balanced, but drinking excessive plain water can be harmful. Carry a small electrolyte mix or rehydration packet as backup.  

**7. Good hygiene prevents most illnesses on the trail**  
Wash your hands with soap before eating and after using the bathroom; sanitizer alone is not enough. Wipe down your body each evening to remove sweat, sunscreen, and grit so your skin stays healthy and your sleep system clean.  
Take care of your feet. Wash or wipe them daily, change socks when they get wet, and air them out during breaks. Treat hot spots as soon as you feel them to prevent blisters. Trim toenails short before the trip to avoid bruising or loss on long descents.  
Carry a small first aid kit with only the basics: wound care, pain relief, and digestive medicine.  

**8. Be safe. Avoid unnecessary risks**  
Most serious backpacking accidents result from falls, drowning, hypothermia, and wildlife encounters. Move carefully on uneven or wet terrain, and use trekking poles to maintain balance. Cross streams only where the water is slow and shallow; unbuckle your pack, face upstream, and turn back if conditions look unsafe. Stay dry to prevent hypothermia. Change into warm layers before you’re cold and keep your insulation protected from rain. Keep your food safe from wildlife at all times. Do not touch, feed, approach, or interfere with animals.  

**9. Respect the wilderness**  
Follow [Leave No Trace](https://lnt.org/why/7-principles/) principles and local regulations designed to protect the backcountry. Camp on durable surfaces like established sites or rock, never on fragile vegetation. Stay at least 200 feet from lakes and streams when washing, bathing, or going to the bathroom. Strain and scatter dishwater away from camp, and never wash dishes directly in lakes or streams. Pack out all trash, food waste, and used toilet paper. Leave what you find, minimize campfire impact, and keep noise low so others and wildlife can enjoy the area undisturbed. Always leave the place better than you found it.
