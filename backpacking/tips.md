# Backpacking Tips

This is an opinionated guide to hiking and camping in the Sierra Nevada and similar mountains. It offers clear, practical tips to help you prepare, stay safe, and enjoy your time out there.

## 1. Required Reading

If you are new to backpacking, I strongly recommend you read through these before going on a trip. 

- REI's [Intro to Backpacking](https://www.rei.com/learn/series/intro-to-backpacking) is one of the best guides out there. If you are a new backpacker, please read each one of the articles in that series. 
- After reading that series, take a look at the REI [Ultralight Backpacking Basics](https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/ultralight-backpacking.html) for tips on reducing the weight of your pack by choosing lightweight gear and doing without some non essential items. 
- If you're going backpacking in the mountains of California, you're hiking in "bear country." Familiarize yourself with the tips found in [Backpacking in Bear Country](https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/backpacking-in-bear-country.html).
- [Leave No Trace principles](https://lnt.org/why/7-principles/)

## 2. What You’re Responsible For

- Know and follow wilderness regulations.
- Secure all food and trash to protect your trip and the wildlife.
- Follow Leave No Trace principles.
- Speak up early if you’re cold, hurt, or struggling.
- Learn the route and be able to navigate on their own.

## 3. Preparation and Testing Before You Go

Before the trip, make sure you know how to:

- Set up and take down your shelter in any conditions
- Use your water filter properly and check it for leaks or clogs
- Stay warm and dry using your sleep system
- Navigate with a map and compass or GPS

Also test and prep:

- Set up your shelter fully and check all stakes, guylines, and anchors
- Boil water with your stove and confirm how much fuel you need
- Run water through your filter at home to verify flow
- Load your pack and do a short hike to check comfort and fit
- (Optional) Treat clothing with permethrin to reduce mosquito bites

## 4. Packing Light

- Make a packing list ahead of time. Don’t guess the night before.
- Use [Lighterpack](https://lighterpack.com) to log weights and spot unnecessary items.
- Start with what you need to stay warm, dry, fed, and safe. Cut from there.
- Don’t pack your fears. Most “just in case” items add weight and rarely get used.
- Aim to keep your total pack weight under 30 lbs, including food, water, and fuel.
- A lighter pack means faster hiking, less fatigue, and more room for comfort items if you want them.

## 5. What to Eat

- Stick to boil-only meals. Skip anything that needs simmering or actual cooking.
- Freeze-dried meals are lighter and last longer than dehydrated ones.
- Backpacking is typically a low to moderate intensity activity, with bursts of higher exertion during climbs or at elevation.
  - Fat is your most efficient fuel — over twice the calories per gram as carbs or protein.
  - Sugary snacks provide quick energy but often cause crashes. Balance with fat and protein.
  - Aim for a food mix of about 50–55% carbs, 30–35% fat, and 10–15% protein.
  - Target 125–140 calories per ounce for weight-efficient energy.

## 6. How to Pack for the Conditions

Summer in the Sierra means strong sun, cold nights, sudden storms, and mosquitoes. Plan for all of them.

- Afternoon thunderstorms are common, especially in July and August. Be off ridgelines early.
- Night temperatures can drop below freezing at elevation. Bring a 30°F sleep system and insulating layers.
- Sun exposure is intense at altitude. Wear a hat, sunglasses, and long sleeves.
- Wind can hit suddenly. Choose sheltered campsites and pitch your shelter tight.

For bugs:

- Mosquitoes are common from June through mid-August, especially near water.
- Treat clothing with permethrin before the trip.
- Carry picaridin lotion for exposed skin. It is effective and gear-safe.
- A head net helps in camp when bugs are active.

## 7. Clothing and Footwear

Bring what works, not what looks good. One hiking outfit is enough. Focus on comfort, weather protection, and recovery.

- Use breathable, fast-drying shirts and shorts or pants. Wool or synthetic both work.
- Always carry a rain shell, even in dry forecasts.
- A midlayer (like fleece) and a puffy jacket keep you warm at camp and in the morning.
- Pack dry sleep clothes: clean socks, underwear, and a base layer top.
- Trail runners are ideal. They are lightweight, breathable, and quick to dry.
- Trim your toenails before the trip.
- Bring two pairs of socks. Rotate daily and air them out during breaks.
- Avoid cotton. It stays wet, causes chafing, and does not insulate.

Optional but useful: learn the heel lock lacing technique to reduce blisters and toe jamming on descents.

## 8. Campsite Selection and Shelter Setup
Practical campsite criteria, plus how to set up a storm-worthy shelter.

- Look for flat, durable ground with some wind protection
- Avoid dips, slopes, and signs of pooling water
- Stay at least 200 feet from water and trails
- Check above for dead branches or leaning trees ("widowmakers")
- Clear sharp rocks, sticks, and pinecones before pitching
- 

## 9. Hygiene and Bathroom Skills

- Always sanitize or wash your hands after using the bathroom and before eating
- Soap sheets (like Fomin or Dr. Bronner’s) work well with a little water
- Alcohol-based hand sanitizer is useful but not enough on its own
- Dry hands with a small towel or clean bandana
Hand hygiene is the #1 way to prevent stomach bugs on trail.
- Use a small towel or wet wipe to clean key areas before bed: face, pits, groin, feet
- Warm water helps. Heat ~500 ml, let it cool, and moisten a towel or wipe
- Use biodegradable soap sparingly, well away from water sources
- Pat dry with a dedicated camp towel
- Go 200 feet from water, trail, and camp
- Dig a 6–8 inch cathole using a proper trowel
- Do your business in the hole and cover it completely
- Pack out all toilet paper and wipes in a sealed zip bag or dog waste bag
- Never bury wipes — even “biodegradable” ones take too long to break down

## 10. First Aid, Foot Care, and Blister Prevention
Focused, concise, and aligned with what hikers actually face.

- Trim toenails before the trip
- Tape known hotspots before hiking (Leukotape or similar)
- Change or rotate socks daily and let them dry at breaks
- If feet get wet, dry them fully at camp and use bread bags or spare socks to manage moisture
- Tape for blisters, basic bandages, daily meds, allergy meds, pain relief
- Patch tape, zip ties, and something to cut with
- Don’t bring a giant kit. Focus on what you know you’ll use
- Carry any daily meds you rely on
- Bring a few ibuprofen, allergy meds, and basic wound care supplies
- Clean and cover small cuts early to prevent infection
- If something’s bothering you — say so early
- 
- You’re not expected to be a medic — but do carry what you personally need
- Know how to care for basic issues: blisters, small wounds, mild reactions, fatigue
- Clean small cuts early and cover them
- If something hurts or feels off, don’t push through in silence


## 11. Water Strategy and Filter Use
How to camel up, carry, filter with Sawyer or Katadyn, find water safely.

- Always filter or treat water — don’t assume it’s safe, even if it looks clean
- Use a filter system you’ve tested. Make sure it flows well and doesn’t leak
- Carry 2–3 liters dirty water capacity (like a CNOC or bladder)
- Carry at least 1 liter clean and sip steadily while hiking
- Add electrolytes if you’re sweating a lot or feeling low energy

Use a squeeze or gravity filter that you’ve tested before the trip.
- Carry 2–3 liters dirty water capacity and at least 1 liter clean.
- Know how to identify safe water sources on trail.
- do not let your filter freeze at night. put it in your sleeping bag if freezing temps expected.

## 12. Sierra-Specific Hazards
Final wrap-up: sun, storms, altitude, dry stretches, etc.
### Common Hazards

- **Sun**: Strong UV and high elevation. Wear long sleeves, hat, and sunglasses
- **Altitude**: Headaches, fatigue, and nausea can hit above 8,000 ft. Stay hydrated and rest if needed
- **Dehydration**: Sip often. Don’t wait until you’re thirsty
- **Storms**: Thunderstorms roll in fast. Be off high ridges by early afternoon
- **Cold**: Even summer nights can drop into the 30s. Change into dry clothes at camp

- Don’t hike far ahead or fall far behind without saying something
- Wait at trail junctions if you’re unsure where the group went
- Speak up if you’re tired, overheated, cold, or unsure — early is best
- Share your skills. Watch out for others. Ask questions when unsure
