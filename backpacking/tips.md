# Backpacking Tips

This is an opinionated guide to hiking and camping in the Sierra Nevada and similar mountains. It offers clear, practical tips to help you prepare, stay safe, and enjoy your time out there.

---

## 1. What Backpacking Really Is

Backpacking means hiking into the wilderness with everything you need on your back: shelter, food, water, sleep gear, clothing. You’ll be away from cell service, bathrooms, and help. This isn’t car camping or a guided trip. You’re responsible for your own safety.

Expect to:

- Hike 6–10 miles a day over uneven terrain
- Filter water from lakes and streams
- Sleep outdoors in unpredictable weather
- Poop in a hole and pack out your toilet paper
- Carry all your gear, food, and trash

---

### What You’re Responsible For

Every person is expected to:

- Carry their own gear and food
- Set up and take down their own shelter
- Filter their own water
- Stay warm and dry with their own sleep system
- Speak up early if something feels off: cold, pain, confusion, anxiety

If you can’t perform the basics on your own, it adds stress to others and can risk group safety. We help each other, but we don’t carry each other.

---

### If You're New, You're Welcome

You don’t need to have it all figured out. Everyone starts somewhere, and mistakes are part of the learning process. What matters is:

- Practicing at home (setup, stove, filtering, packing)
- Doing a short hike with your loaded pack
- Staying vocal — ask questions and speak up early

---

## 2. Planning & Preparation

Backpacking success starts long before your boots hit the trail. Knowing where you’re going, what to expect, and how to prepare will make the difference between a tough-but-rewarding adventure and a miserable one.

---

### Know Your Route

- Learn your trailhead, campsites, mileage, and elevation gain
- Identify key water sources and where they might run dry
- Have at least one bailout option if plans change
- Download offline maps to your phone (Avenza, CalTopo, onX, etc)
- Carry a printed map as a backup

---

### Permits & Rules

- Most Sierra trailheads require wilderness permits
- Check for fire restrictions, food storage requirements, and camping restrictions
- Don’t wing it. Learn the rules before you go

---

### Weather Awareness

- Afternoon thunderstorms are common in summer, even on clear days
- Night temps can dip into the 30s, especially at high elevation
- Sun exposure is intense. Bring long sleeves, hat, and sunglasses
- Wind and bugs both show up fast. Prepare for both

---

### Practice at Home

- Set up your shelter and make sure it works
- Test your stove and know how much fuel you’ll need
- Filter water from a sink or bucket and make sure it flows properly
- Load your pack and take it on a short hike

---

### Fitness & Reality

- You don’t need to be a triathlete, but hiking with weight at altitude is hard
- Train by walking hills with a pack
- Know your limits and communicate them. Overexertion helps no one

---

### Leave No Trace Basics

- Pack out everything: trash, food scraps, used toilet paper
- Camp at least 200 feet from lakes and streams
- Stay on trail and avoid shortcuts
- Respect quiet, privacy, and wildlife

---

### Share Your Plan

- Give your route, camps, and return date to someone at home
- Include your car location and expected check-in time
- If things go wrong, this is what helps people find you

---

## 3. Gear & Packing Strategy

Your gear keeps you warm, dry, fed, and safe — but only if you know how to use it. Don’t worry about having the “best” gear. Focus on systems that work together, and make sure you’ve tested them before you go.

For product-specific recommendations, see the [Gear Selection Guide](gear-advice.md).

---

### The Big Three

These are your heaviest and most important items. Practice with them before the trip.

- **Backpack**: Should carry 25–35 pounds comfortably. Adjust the fit and hike with it loaded.
- **Shelter**: Tent, tarp, or hammock — pitch it in your yard, check for stakes, guylines, and tension.
- **Sleep System**: A 30°F quilt or sleeping bag with an insulated pad is a good match for summer Sierra trips.

---

### Clothing: Layer for the Range

Bring layers that handle heat, wind, sun, and cold nights. One hiking outfit is enough.

- **Hiking layers**: Breathable, fast-drying shirt and shorts or pants
- **Midlayer**: Fleece or active insulation for warmth while moving
- **Puffy**: Down or synthetic jacket for camp and mornings
- **Rain shell**: Always bring one, even in dry forecasts
- **Sleep clothes**: Dry socks and underwear reserved for camp

Avoid cotton. Wet cotton chills fast and dries slowly.

---

### Footwear & Socks

- Use what’s broken in and works for you. Trail runners are common because they dry fast and feel light.
- Trim toenails before the trip.
- Bring two pairs of socks. Rotate daily. Air them out during breaks.

If your feet fall apart, the rest of the trip doesn’t matter.

---

### Water System

- Use a squeeze or gravity filter that you’ve tested before the trip.
- Carry 2–3 liters dirty water capacity and at least 1 liter clean.
- Know how to identify safe water sources on trail.

---

### Cooking & Eating

- Most meals are boil-only: heat water, pour it in, wait.
- A low flame is most efficient, unless its windy. Avoid full blast as it wastes fuel.
- A single 550-750 ml pot and long-handled spoon is all most people need.
- No need to bring bowls, plates, or extras unless you really need them.

---

### Food Storage

- Use a bear canister or Ursack depending on trip rules.
- Store all smellables: food, trash, sunscreen, toothpaste, lip balm.
- Place bear canisters 100+ feet from camp, ideally in shade.
- Ursacks shoud be nearby, because you need to scare the bear away from it.

Never leave food unattended — not even for a minute.

---

### First Aid & Repair

Bring the basics and know how to use them.

- Tape for blisters, basic bandages, daily meds, allergy meds, pain relief
- Patch tape, zip ties, and something to cut with
- Don’t bring a giant kit. Focus on what you know you’ll use

---

### Useful Extras

- Headlamp 
- Trekking poles (if they help with knees or balance)
- Trowel and hand soap for bathroom and hygiene
- Small towel or bandana for drying and cleanup

---

## 4. Trail Skills & On-Trail Safety

Navigation and awareness all help prevent small mistakes from turning into real problems. Everyone on the trip shares responsibility for staying found and staying safe.

---

### Navigation Basics

- Learn your route: trailhead, campsites, mileage, water sources, elevation
- Always know roughly where you are and where you're headed next
- Use a GPS app with offline maps (CalTopo, Gaia, onX)
- Carry a paper map as backup
- Stop at every junction — never assume, never blindly follow

Navigation is a skill. Don’t zone out and trust someone else to do it for you.

---

### Group Awareness

- Don’t hike far ahead or fall far behind without saying something
- Wait at trail junctions if you’re unsure where the group went
- Speak up if you’re tired, overheated, cold, or unsure — early is best
- Share your skills. Watch out for others. Ask questions when unsure

---

### Common Hazards

- **Sun**: Strong UV and high elevation. Wear long sleeves, hat, and sunglasses
- **Altitude**: Headaches, fatigue, and nausea can hit above 8,000 ft. Stay hydrated and rest if needed
- **Dehydration**: Sip often. Don’t wait until you’re thirsty
- **Storms**: Thunderstorms roll in fast. Be off high ridges by early afternoon
- **Cold**: Even summer nights can drop into the 30s. Change into dry clothes at camp

---

### First Aid Mindset

- You’re not expected to be a medic — but do carry what you personally need
- Know how to care for basic issues: blisters, small wounds, mild reactions, fatigue
- Clean small cuts early and cover them
- If something hurts or feels off, don’t push through in silence
 
---

### Getting Lost

- Stop moving. Think before you act
- Check your GPS and map
- Retrace your steps only if you’re sure it’s safe
- If completely lost or separated, stay put and make yourself visible

Your best defense is prevention: stay alert, know the plan, and speak up.

## 5. Campsite Setup & Sleep

Your shelter, sleep system, and campsite choice all work together to keep you warm, dry, and rested. Most sleep issues are caused by poor setup, bad site choice, or avoidable condensation. You don’t need luxury — you need consistency.

---

### Choosing a Campsite

- Look for flat, durable ground with some wind protection
- Avoid dips, slopes, and signs of pooling water
- Stay at least 200 feet from water and trails
- Check above for dead branches or leaning trees ("widowmakers")
- Clear sharp rocks, sticks, and pinecones before pitching

Use your eyes and feet. A few extra minutes spent picking a good site makes a huge difference overnight.

---

### Shelter Setup Tips

- Practice at home until setup feels automatic
- Pitch your shelter tight and angled to shed wind and rain
- Use all guy-out points if wind or storms are likely
- Vent the shelter at both ends to reduce condensation
- If bugs are out, close everything early — they get worse at dusk

Tarp users: know how to adjust pitch for wind and rain. Don’t wing it in the field.

---

### Sleep System Habits

- A warm pad is more important than a warm quilt. Most heat loss is downward
- Wear dry sleep clothes — socks, underwear, maybe a base layer top
- Keep extra clothes inside your quilt or bag so they’re not frozen in the morning
- Crack shelter doors to help with airflow and prevent condensation

---

### Staying Warm

- Eat something before bed to give your body fuel
- Wear a beanie and puffy jacket if you’re cold
- Don’t sleep in wet clothes — ever
- If cold persists, check for drafts in your quilt or gaps in pad coverage

Warmth comes from layers, food, and a tight sleep setup — not from suffering through the night.

---

### Bug Season Tips

- Mosquitoes are common June through mid-August in the Sierra
- Wear long sleeves and pants, ideally treated with permethrin
- Use a head net in camp if bugs are aggressive
- Picaridin lotion works well and won’t damage gear

Bug netting or a sealed tent can make the difference between sleeping and swatting.

---

If you’re cold, wet, or sleep-deprived, nothing else will feel right. A solid camp routine makes everything better.

## 6. Food, Water & Cooking

You don’t need gourmet meals or fancy gear. Backpacking food is about energy, simplicity, and safety. Keep it calorie-dense, easy to prepare, and resistant to spoilage. You’re fueling movement and recovery — not dining out.

---

### Meal Planning

- Aim for 2,500–3,500 calories per day depending on your body and activity
- Prioritize calorie-dense foods: tortillas, nut butters, hard cheese, meat sticks, trail mix
- Repack food at home to save weight and reduce trash
- Keep it simple. Avoid anything that needs to simmer or has complicated prep
- Don’t overpack. Most people bring too many snacks

Pro Tip: Target foods with 125–140 calories per ounce and a good mix of fat, carbs, and protein

---

### Cooking on Trail

- Most backpackers just boil water, pour it into a bag or pot, and wait
- A small upright canister stove and ~750 ml pot are all you need
- Long-handled spoon keeps hands clean and reaches into bags
- No bowls or mugs needed unless you’ve already tested and want them
- Cold soak works fine — but only if you’ve practiced

Cook what you know. Field time is not the place to experiment.

---

### Water Collection & Treatment

- Always filter or treat water — don’t assume it’s safe, even if it looks clean
- Use a filter system you’ve tested. Make sure it flows well and doesn’t leak
- Carry 2–3 liters dirty water capacity (like a CNOC or bladder)
- Carry at least 1 liter clean and sip steadily while hiking
- Add electrolytes if you’re sweating a lot or feeling low energy

Plan around dry stretches. Don’t pass water thinking the next source is guaranteed.

---

### Food Storage

- Bear canisters or Ursacks are required in most Sierra wilderness areas
- Store all smellables: food, trash, toothpaste, sunscreen, lip balm, wrappers
- Keep your food 100+ feet from your sleeping area, ideally in shade
- Never leave food out — not even briefly

Food mismanagement is the fastest way to ruin a trip or get fined.

---

Food should fuel you, not frustrate you. Keep it compact, tasty, and efficient — and make sure you know how you’ll store and prepare it ahead of time.

## 7. Hygiene, Bathroom & Health

Backcountry hygiene is simple: keep your hands clean, your body functional, and your waste properly managed. You don’t need to be spotless — just healthy and respectful of the environment.

---

### Going to the Bathroom

- Go 200 feet from water, trail, and camp
- Dig a 6–8 inch cathole using a proper trowel
- Do your business in the hole and cover it completely
- Pack out all toilet paper and wipes in a sealed zip bag or dog waste bag
- Never bury wipes — even “biodegradable” ones take too long to break down

Avoid damaging plant roots and be discreet. Leave no trace means exactly that.

---

### Hand Hygiene

- Always sanitize or wash your hands after using the bathroom and before eating
- Soap sheets (like Fomin or Dr. Bronner’s) work well with a little water
- Alcohol-based hand sanitizer is useful but not enough on its own
- Dry hands with a small towel or clean bandana

Hand hygiene is the #1 way to prevent stomach bugs on trail.

---

### Nightly Washdown

- Use a small towel or wet wipe to clean key areas before bed: face, pits, groin, feet
- Warm water helps. Heat ~500 ml, let it cool, and moisten a towel or wipe
- Use biodegradable soap sparingly, well away from water sources
- Pat dry with a dedicated camp towel

You don’t need to feel clean — just not gross. It helps you sleep and reduces chafing.

---

### Foot Care

- Trim toenails before the trip
- Tape known hotspots before hiking (Leukotape or similar)
- Change or rotate socks daily and let them dry at breaks
- If feet get wet, dry them fully at camp and use bread bags or spare socks to manage moisture

Blisters and trench foot are trip-enders. Stay ahead of them.

---

### Health Basics

- Carry any daily meds you rely on
- Bring a few ibuprofen, allergy meds, and basic wound care supplies
- Clean and cover small cuts early to prevent infection
- If something’s bothering you — say so early

A little prevention goes a long way. You don’t need to be clean, but you do need to be functional.


## 8. Sharpening Skills & Troubleshooting

Good backpackers aren’t perfect — they’re adaptable. The more you practice, the better you’ll handle setbacks. What matters most is not avoiding every problem, but knowing how to respond when something goes wrong.

---

### Practice Before the Trip

- Set up your shelter in your yard or a park
- Filter water from a sink or bucket to test for leaks and flow
- Boil water with your stove and time how long it takes
- Load your pack and do a short hike to adjust straps and spot problems
- Try your full sleep system on a cool night

Confidence comes from practice, not reading.

---

### Learn to Improvise

- Tenacious tape, rubber bands, and zip ties fix a lot of gear problems
- Pack liner torn? Use your extra trash bag
- Trekking pole basket broke? Cut a stick and make a spacer
- Wet feet? Bread bags inside shoes can save the day

You won’t anticipate everything. Being creative matters more.

---

### Gear Failure Happens

- Water filter clogs? Backflush or share someone else’s
- Shelter fails? Use emergency cordage and pitch a minimal tarp
- Quilt feels cold? Block drafts, eat something, add clothing layers
- Battery dies? Use a headlamp with a spare or carry a small charger

Don’t panic. Slow down, problem-solve, and ask for help if needed.

---

### Mental Game

- Expect discomfort. Rain, wind, heat, or fatigue will show up
- You’ll make mistakes. That’s normal — fix them and keep going
- Speak up if you’re not doing well. Don’t suffer in silence
- Stay curious. Ask questions. Learn from others

The backcountry rewards patience, self-awareness, and humility. Nobody’s here to win. We’re here to grow and enjoy it.
