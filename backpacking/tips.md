## Backpacking Tips

These tips reflect what keeps our trips safe and enjoyable year after year. They’re written for anyone who wants to stay safe, travel light, and make good decisions in the backcountry — whether it’s your first overnight or your fiftieth.

### Be Prepared

- **Preparation prevents problems.**  
  Most issues start before the trail — from untested gear, poor planning, or skipped training. Plan with margin and test your setup.  

- **Get in shape for the trip.**  
  Hiking is one thing; hiking with weight at elevation is another. Build fitness before you go so you can handle climbs, descents, and thinner air safely.  

- **Protect what keeps you alive.**  
  Keep your sleep system, insulation, and shelter dry and functional. Safeguard the gear your safety depends on.  

- **The wilderness sets the terms.**  
  Start early, stay observant, and adjust your plans to conditions instead of forcing them. Adaptability is a safety skill.  

### Be Light

- **The weight you carry shapes your trip.**  
  Every extra pound costs energy, speed, and enjoyment. Going light expands your comfort zone and margin for error.  

- **Eliminate before you upgrade.**  
  Simplifying is lighter than spending. Learn what you can leave behind before buying lighter versions.  

- **Fear adds weight.**  
  Packing for every “what if” creates burden. Knowledge and calm replace most backup gear.  

- **Comfort comes from habits, not gear.**  
  Staying warm, dry, and rested depends on your discipline — layering well, eating right, drying out, and caring for your feet.  

### Be Timely

- **Start early and use the day well.**  
  Move when it’s cool, cross passes before storms, and set up camp with time to spare.  

- **Take breaks before you need them.**  
  Resting early keeps energy steady and judgment clear.  

### Be Respectful

- **Be considerate of others.**  
  Everyone’s safety and enjoyment depend on good communication and cooperation.  

- **Take care of the places you visit.**  
  Follow local rules, pack out everything, and leave campsites cleaner than you found them.
