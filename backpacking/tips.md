# Backpacking Tips

This is an opinionated guide to hiking and camping in the Sierra Nevada and similar mountains. Follow these, and you’ll be safe, comfortable, and more likely to have fun.

## 1. Required Reading

Before you start asking questions, **get the basics down**. These cover skills, gear, and etiquette that everyone should know.

- REI’s [Intro to Backpacking](https://www.rei.com/learn/series/intro-to-backpacking) — read the full series.
- [Ultralight Backpacking Basics](https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/ultralight-backpacking.html) — how to cut weight without cutting safety.
- [Backpacking in Bear Country](https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/backpacking-in-bear-country.html) — Sierra-specific food safety.
- [Leave No Trace principles](https://lnt.org/why/7-principles/) — the standard for protecting the places you visit.

## 2. What You’re Responsible For

Everyone is responsible for **their own safety, impact, and preparation** — even if you’re not the trip leader. Even when you’re self-sufficient, backpacking with others means your choices affect the whole group. Share plans, coordinate gear, and be willing to adjust pace or route.

- Know and follow wilderness regulations.
- Secure all food and trash from wildlife.
- Follow Leave No Trace principles.
- Speak up early if you’re uncomfortable, tired, or unsure about a decision.
- Learn the route and be able to navigate on your own.

## 3. Preparation and Testing Before You Go

Most issues on the trail come from lack of preparation, gear that hasn’t been tested, packs that are too heavy, or bodies that aren’t ready for the effort. The goal is to arrive with both equipment and fitness that work for you.

- Set up and take down your shelter until you can do it in the dark and wind.  
- Use your water filter; confirm it flows well and doesn’t leak.  
- Sleep in your system at home or on a short trip to check warmth and comfort.  
- Boil water with your stove and confirm how much fuel you’ll actually use.  
- Load your pack with everything you plan to bring and hike a few miles to check comfort and balance.  
- Navigate with a map and compass or GPS. Don’t rely on someone else.  
- Treat clothing with permethrin well before the trip to keep mosquitoes down.  
- Train your body as well as your gear. See [Backpacking Fitness Plan](fitness.md) for tips.  

## 4. Packing Light

The most common beginner mistake is **packing your fears** — bringing extra clothes, gear, and “what if” items that never get used. Every extra pound in your pack costs you energy and comfort over the miles. Be deliberate with what you carry and trim weight wherever it won’t compromise safety.

- Make a detailed packing list a week before the trip. Revise it.
- Start with the essentials for staying warm, dry, fed, and safe.
- Cut backups unless something is critical to survival.
- Use [LighterPack](https://lighterpack.com) to weigh and track your gear.
- Aim for a total pack weight under 30 lbs including food, water, and fuel.
- Multi-use gear beats single-use (e.g. trekking pole tent, buff as hat/neck gaiter, pot as mug).
- A lighter pack means less fatigue, fewer injuries, and more enjoyment.

> **Reality Check: The Weight You Carry is the Trip You Get**
>
> The lighter your pack, the more you’ll enjoy the hike. Heavy gear will slow you down, cause fatigue, and make the trip less fun.
>
> Weigh your gear and avoid “just in case” extras. Keep your total pack weight under 30 lbs with food, water, and fuel. If you can’t, start cutting.

## 5. What to Eat

Keep it simple, high-energy, and easy to prepare. Test your food strategy just like your gear. Bring foods you know you’ll eat when tired, cold, or hot, and skip anything you won’t want on the trail no matter how healthy it looks.

- Stick to freeze-dried meals that only require boiling water. These are simple and use much less fuel than simmering.  
- Aim for about 50–55% carbs, 30–35% fat, and 10–15% protein.  
- Target 125–140 calories per ounce for efficiency.  
- Balance quick carbs with fat and protein to avoid energy crashes.  

## 6. Conditions and How to Handle Them

In the Sierra, you’ll often get **strong sun, cold nights, sudden storms, and mosquitoes in the same trip**. Plan for all of it.

**Sun and Heat**
- Wear long sleeves, pants, sunglasses, and a wide-brim hat.
- Use breathable, quick-drying fabrics. Avoid cotton.
- Sip water steadily; add electrolytes in hot conditions.
- Rest in shade during the hottest hours instead of pushing through.

**Cold and Night**
- Expect nights in the 30s. Bring a 30°F-rated bag or quilt.
- Fleece or active insulation for hiking; puffy for camp.
- Sleep in dry socks and a base layer top.

**Rain and Wind**
- Thunderstorms often hit in the afternoon. Be off ridges early.
- Always carry a rain shell.
- Camp in sheltered spots and pitch low in high winds.

**Bugs**
- Mosquitoes are worst June–mid August.
- Treat clothes with permethrin.
- Use picaridin on exposed skin.
- Head net for camp sanity.

## 7. Foot Care and Footwear

Your feet carry you the whole way — **protect them like your trip depends on it**.

- Trail runners are lighter and dry faster than boots for most summer trips.
- Break shoes in before the trip.
- Trim toenails short.
- Bring two pairs of socks; rotate daily.
- Address hotspots immediately.
- Heel lock lacing prevents sliding, blisters, and toe bang.

## 8. Campsite Selection and Shelter Setup

A good campsite means **better sleep and fewer problems**.

- Pick flat, durable ground with wind protection.
- Avoid dips, slopes, and flood-prone spots.
- Stay at least 200 feet from water and trails.
- Check overhead for dead branches or leaning trees.
- Clear sharp rocks and sticks before pitching.

## 9. Hygiene

Stay clean enough to stay healthy. **Soap beats sanitizer in camp**.

- Wash hands after the bathroom, before eating, after collecting water, and after fishing.
- Soap sheets are lighter and easier than liquid soap.
- Wipe down face, feet, pits, and groin at camp.
- Pack out all used toilet paper or wipes in a sealed bag.

## 10. First Aid

Your kit should match the problems you’re most likely to face.

- Bring your personal meds — missing a daily dose can end a trip.
- Pack a few pain relievers.
- Carry Imodium or antacids for gut issues.
- Treat blisters early with Leukotape or moleskin.
- Clean and cover small cuts to prevent infection.

## 11. Water Strategy and Filter Use

Water keeps you moving — **have a reliable primary and backup method**.

- Always treat water, no matter how clear it looks.
- Keep dirty and clean containers separate.
- Drink a liter at each water stop (“camel up”).
- Let silty water settle before filtering.
- Sleep with your filter in freezing temps.
- Carry backup tablets (Micropur or chlorine dioxide).

## 12. Sierra-Specific Hazards

The Sierra looks friendly until it isn’t. **Know the risks and plan accordingly**.

- Sun: High UV — long sleeves, hat, sunglasses.
- Altitude: Above 8,000 ft, ascend slowly, hydrate, rest if sick.
- Dehydration: Drink steadily; don’t rely on thirst.
- Storms: Off ridges by early afternoon.
- Cold: Nights below freezing are possible — have insulation.
- Falls: Stay on trail; Sierra rock can be loose.

## 13. Leave No Trace Mistakes

Most violations aren’t dramatic — they’re small, lazy mistakes. **Don’t be that person**.

- Dropping micro-trash.
- Burning trash in fire pits.
- Leaving food waste (scraps, peels, crumbs).
- Leaving smelly gear unattended.
- Leaving toilet paper exposed or buried.
