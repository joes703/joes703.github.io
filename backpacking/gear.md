## Gear Selection Advice

This section includes some advice on choosing gear.

### Pack

For multi-day trips, choose a pack that fits your torso and hips properly. Get measured to be sure. Look for a 45–60L capacity, an internal frame, and a padded hip belt for comfort. Make sure it can hold a bear canister either inside or under the lid, and opt for useful external pockets like a mesh front, side bottle holders, and hip belt storage. Avoid packs over 4–5 lbs unless you truly need to carry extreme loads. A poorly supported pack will struggle with a bear canister, and frameless designs generally only work well if your base weight is under 10 lbs.

**Top Picks**
- Durston Kakwa 55 – Structured, light, Ultra fabric, bear can fits inside
- REI Flash 55 – Modular, comfortable, good value
- Gossamer Gear Mariposa 60 – Light, comfy, tons of external storage
- Granite Gear Crown 3 60 – Versatile, durable, and well-padded

### Shelter

Choose a shelter in the 1–3 lb range that is storm-worthy, ventilated, and easy to pitch. This is especially important at high elevations where weather can turn quickly. Make sure it fits you and your pad comfortably, and that you feel confident setting it up. Avoid tents over 4.5 lbs, single-wall designs with poor airflow, and trekking pole tents you have not practiced with beforehand. Freestanding tents are the easiest to pitch, but whatever you choose, practice at home. In windy conditions, use all guylines and keep vents open to reduce condensation.

**Top Picks**
- Durston X-Mid 1 – Roomy, stable, beginner-friendly, great value
- 3F UL Lanshan 1 Pro – Trekking pole tent, strong following, solid for the price
- Gossamer Gear The One – Ultralight, great interior space, requires care with setup

### Sleep System

For Sierra summer trips, a quilt or sleeping bag with a 20–30°F rating offers the best mix of warmth and versatility. Pair it with a sleeping pad rated R-4.0 or higher to stay insulated on granite or other cold ground. Focus on warmth-to-weight ratio, comfort, and packability over chasing the absolute lightest option. Down remains the standard for its excellent warmth and compressibility, and with modern shell fabrics and water-resistant treatments, moisture concerns are minimal when you store it properly. Skip heavy synthetic bags without a tested rating and avoid pads below R-3.5 for high-elevation camping.

**Top Picks – Quilts & Sleeping Bags (under $400)**
- EE Enigma 20°F Quilt – Ultralight, customizable, proven favorite
- REI Magma 15/30 – Excellent performance at a fair price
- Hammock Gear Economy Burrow 20 – Budget-friendly, warm, and customizable

### Cook System

For most backpackers, a simple boil-only canister setup is the lightest, fastest, and most versatile choice. Pair a small upright canister stove with a pot sized to your needs—usually 600–900 ml for solo trips. Titanium is the standard for its strength, low weight, and durability, but it creates hot spots that can scorch food if you cook more than just boil water. Aluminum spreads heat more evenly and is better for simmering or cooking real meals, though it’s slightly heavier. Keep it minimal: one pot, one utensil, one lighter. Canister stoves work reliably at high Sierra elevations and are allowed where alcohol and wood stoves are often banned. Avoid bulky multi-pot kits, frying pans, or nesting cookware you do not need. Modern heat-exchanger pots like the Fire-Maple Petrel G2 can improve fuel efficiency in windy or cold conditions, but plain titanium remains the gold standard for pure weight savings. Skip oversized systems unless you regularly cook for two or more people.

**Top Picks – Stoves**
- Soto WindMaster (87 g / 3.1 oz) – Best in wind, very efficient
- Soto Amicus (75 g / 2.6 oz) – Great budget option, reliable

- Fire-Maple Greenpeak II (135 g / 4.8 oz) – Budget-friendly, pressure regulated
- TOAKS STV-21 (45 g / 1.6 oz) – Lightweight, solid performer, minimalist design

**Top Picks – Pots**
- TOAKS Titanium 750 ml (90 g / 3.2 oz) – Lightweight, durable, simple
- TOAKS Titanium 900 ml (115 g / 4.1 oz) – Same great design, more volume
- Fire-Maple Petrel G2 (149 g / 5.3 oz) – Aluminum with heat exchanger; efficient and fuel-saving

### Food Storage

In most of the Sierra, a bear canister is required, so start with one that’s approved for your destination and sized for your trip length. Clear models make it easier to find items, while carbon-fiber designs save weight at a higher cost. Where canisters are not required, an approved bear-resistant bag like the Ursack can save weight, but they must be cinched fully closed and secured to a solid anchor (tree trunk or branch) to keep bears and rodents out. Ursacks prevent animals from getting to your food but do not protect it from being crushed. When using a canister, place it at least 100 feet from camp, away from cliffs, water, or game trails. When using an Ursack, secure it to a nearby tree within view of your tent so you can hear if an animal disturbs it. Use odor-proof liners inside any container to keep scents contained, and organize food, trash, and snacks separately for efficiency. Never store food in your tent or leave wrappers loose in your pack.

**Top Picks – Bear Canisters**
- BearVault BV475 Trek – Clear, easy to use, fits 5–6 days solo or 4 days with extra space for bulky food
- BearVault BV450 – Best for 4-day solo trips when space is tight and you pack efficiently
- Garcia Backpackers’ Cache – Rugged, simple, rentable
- Bearikade Weekender / Expedition – Lightest option, expensive, rental available

**Top Picks – Bear-Resistant Bags *(only where permitted)***
- Ursack Major / AllMitey – Light, tear- and puncture-resistant; must be fully cinched, anchored, and kept close to camp
- Adotec Ultralight Food Locker – IGBC-approved; check your destination first

### Water Filtration

A lightweight squeeze or gravity filter is the simplest and most reliable choice for Sierra trips. Pair it with a 2–3L dirty water bag and at least 1L of clean water carry. Match your filter to your water bag threading: the Katadyn BeFree uses 42mm threads, while the Sawyer Squeeze, Sawyer Mini, and Platypus QuickDraw use 28mm. CNOC Vecto bags remain a top choice for fast water collection thanks to their wide opening, durability, and packability. Avoid straw-style filters that require you to drink directly from the source, and be careful not to cross-contaminate clean and dirty containers. Always test and soak your filter before the trip to ensure it flows well. For long carries, keep at least a liter of clean water between sources—more in dry or exposed sections. Also carry a small backup treatment method like Katadyn Micropur or chlorine dioxide tablets in case your filter clogs, freezes, or is lost.

**Top Picks – Filters**
- Katadyn BeFree – Fastest flow rate, simple swish-to-clean maintenance; not backflushable and needs more frequent replacement
- Sawyer Squeeze – Durable, fully backflushable, works for both squeeze and gravity setups
- Platypus QuickDraw – Good flow, backflushable, easy to clean in the field, works for both squeeze and gravity setups

**Top Picks – Dirty Water Bags**
- CNOC Vecto 2L (28mm or 42mm) – Wide opening for fast fills, durable, packs small  
- Any squeezable pouch or bottle compatible with your filter threads will work if you don’t need wide-mouth filling

### Clothing

Bring one set of hiking clothes and one set of clean, dry sleep clothes. A smart backpacking clothing system is built around lightweight layers that dry quickly, manage moisture, and can be worn across a wide range of conditions. Think in terms of a layering system that covers three functions: sun protection, insulation, and weather protection. Avoid cotton, backup “just in case” items, or outfit swapping. Clothing is one of the fastest ways to add unnecessary weight.

Your hiking kit should be worn all day and include a long-sleeve sun shirt (synthetic or merino) for UV and bug protection, shorts or breathable hiking pants for comfort on hot days, merino or synthetic underwear, and hiking socks. Merino wool is naturally odor resistant, manages moisture well, and insulates even when damp, making it an excellent choice for socks and base layers. Synthetic fabrics dry faster and are often more durable. For pants, look for breathable, stretchy fabrics that vent heat while still blocking wind. Choose pieces that allow a full range of motion and won’t chafe when worn for long days under a pack. A buff, wide-brim sun hat or cap, and lightweight gloves round out your daytime protection. Your camp and sleep kit should stay clean and dry, with a lightweight base layer top and bottom, a dry pair of socks for sleeping, and an insulated jacket (down or synthetic) for warmth. Add a beanie and lightweight gloves for chilly mornings at elevation. Never hike in your sleep clothes.

Always carry a rain jacket, even in summer. Wind pants or a wind shirt are optional but valuable in cold, windy, or prolonged storms, especially at high elevation. Treat shirts, pants, and hats with permethrin to deter ticks and mosquitoes. Focus on layering to adapt to conditions rather than packing multiple complete outfits. You will wear the same hiking clothes every day, and that is normal.

For detailed research on clothing that stays cool in hot Sierra conditions while providing sun and insect protection, see [Deputy Sean’s Guide to Sierra Summer Wear](https://imgur.com/a/deputyseans-guide-to-sierra-summer-wear-shirts-aCThT23). His guide covers shirts, pants, and accessories, emphasizing high-UPF fabrics, breathable weaves, light colors to reflect heat, and accessory choices that balance coverage with ventilation.

Since clothing is very much a personal taste and choice, I have no specific brand recommendations here.

### Footwear

Choose footwear that matches your terrain, mileage, and personal comfort. For most Sierra summer trips, trail runners are the go-to option because they are lightweight, breathable, and dry quickly after creek crossings or rain. Look for a wide toe box to accommodate swelling over multi-day hikes, and make sure the grip and cushioning can handle long, rocky descents without beating up your feet. 

Avoid heavy boots unless you specifically need ankle support or are traveling over snow. Break in new shoes before your trip to avoid blisters. Skip waterproof shoes in summer since they trap heat and sweat, making your feet more prone to hotspots and blisters.

Fit matters more than brand. Always try shoes on with your hiking socks and any insoles you plan to use. If you have arch pain or discomfort after long days, experiment with aftermarket insoles, as the right support can make a big difference in comfort and injury prevention. Consider adding lightweight shoe gaiters to keep rocks, sand, and other debris from getting into your shoes. During the hike, address any discomfort immediately instead of pushing through. It is far easier to prevent foot problems than to recover from them.

### Electronics

For most backpacking trips, a simple and lightweight electronics setup is all you need. Carry a rechargeable headlamp, a small battery bank, and your smartphone preloaded with offline maps from apps like Avenza or CalTopo. Bring only the cables you need and manage power carefully by keeping your phone in airplane mode, dimming the screen, and turning off background app refresh. Heavy multi-battery flashlights or lanterns add unnecessary weight, and solar panels are rarely efficient enough on the move to justify carrying. Avoid relying entirely on your phone battery for navigation, communication, and lighting without a backup power source.

A 10,000 mAh battery bank is sufficient for most 3–5 day trips, especially if you conserve power and only charge essential devices. Download maps and weather forecasts before leaving the trailhead so you are not dependent on a cell signal. For best battery health, begin charging devices when they drop to around 20–30 percent and stop charging at 80–90 percent rather than draining to empty or topping off to 100 percent every time. Charge devices only when needed, and avoid leaving them plugged in after they reach the target level. Do not charge devices overnight when you cannot monitor them. Protect electronics from cold by keeping them in your sleeping bag or pocket during freezing nights. Keep your electronics accessible but protected from moisture, and always verify that your critical devices are fully charged before setting out.

### Hygiene

Your hygiene kit should be minimal, lightweight, and focused on essential cleanliness rather than comfort items. Include soap for actual handwashing at camp, not just sanitizer, and store everything in a small ziplock or lightweight pouch. Soap sheets are often the best choice in the field since they are lighter, less messy, and easier to portion than liquid soap. Avoid full-size products, deodorant, scented items, or specialty “trail shampoos.” Relying on wipes alone is not enough for good hygiene in the backcountry.

A solid core kit includes a compact or trimmed toothbrush, toothpaste sections or tabs (two to four per day), a small length of dental floss, soap sheets or unscented soap in a dropper bottle, and a small bottle of hand sanitizer. Add toilet paper or wipes, a lightweight trowel, and lip balm with SPF. Optional items like a compact mirror or nail clippers can be included if you find them useful. 

Wash your hands with soap before eating and also after using the bathroom, collecting water, fishing, or handling anything that could contaminate food. Sanitizer is a good supplement but not a substitute in camp environments. Label your toilet paper trash bag if you are in a group to avoid mix-ups. At camp, take a minute to wipe down your face, feet, armpits, and groin — this small step will make you feel far more comfortable and reduce the risk of chafing or skin irritation.

### First Aid

Your first aid kit should be compact, tailored to the conditions, and focused on the problems you are most likely to face in the backcountry. This usually means treating blisters, small cuts, pain, and common digestive issues. Start with a small pouch and add only what you know how to use, along with any personal medications and preferred tape. Skip bulky prepackaged kits filled with items you cannot name or have never used, and avoid overpacking for rare emergencies that could be managed by improvising with gear you already carry.

A solid kit includes a few key medications such as ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and antihistamines, plus Imodium, Pepto, or an acid reducer for stomach issues, and any personal prescriptions you require. For wound and blister care, bring Leukotape or blister pads, adhesive bandages in several sizes, a small amount of gauze, and Steri-Strips. Include tweezers, a small pair of scissors, a safety pin, and a single pair of nitrile gloves. Regularly check your kit before trips to replace expired medications or worn-out supplies, and make sure you know how to use every item you bring.
