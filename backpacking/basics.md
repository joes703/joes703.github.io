# Backpacking Basics

This guide walks through the basics of planning, packing, and staying comfortable on your first backpacking trip.  
It builds on the principles from [Backpacking Tips](tips.md) and points to the [Gear Guide](gear.md) for detailed recommendations.

## Before You Go

- **Plan early.**  
  Give yourself time to train, test your gear, and fix problems before you leave. Your first trip of the season always takes more prep than you expect.

- **Check the forecast.**  
  Sierra trips often bring strong sun, rain or thunderstorms, cold nights, and mosquitoes — sometimes all in one day. Pack for all of it.

- **Train with your pack.**  
  Hike with weight before your trip to get used to the load and elevation. It’s the best way to avoid fatigue or injury later.

- **Use a checklist.**  
  Pack methodically so nothing gets left behind. Keep insulation and sleep gear in a waterproof liner or dry bag.

- **Tell someone your plans.**  
  Share your route, group members, and return date with a reliable contact. Cell service can’t be counted on.

## Essentials to Pack

This isn’t a full gear list — it’s what every backpacker needs, regardless of brand or weight.  
See the [Gear Guide](gear.md) for detailed gear advice and product comparisons.

**Shelter and Sleep**
- Tent, tarp, or hammock with adequate rain protection  
- Sleeping bag or quilt rated for the lowest expected temperature  
- Sleeping pad for insulation and comfort  

**Clothing**
- Lightweight hiking layers (synthetic or merino)  
- Warm midlayer (fleece or light puffy)  
- Rain jacket and rain protection for pack  
- Sleep clothes kept dry in a separate bag  
- Hat, sunglasses, and sun protection  

**Cooking and Food**
- Stove and fuel (test at home)  
- Pot, spoon, and lighter or matches  
- Simple meals that need only hot water  
- Snacks and electrolytes for the trail  
- Bear can or Ursack for food storage (required in most Sierra areas)  

**Water**
- Filter or purifier with backup (tabs or drops)  
- Two to three liters of total water capacity  
- Collect from flowing sources when possible  

**Navigation and Safety**
- Offline maps and compass  
- First aid kit with tape and blister care  
- Headlamp with fresh batteries  
- Repair tape and cord  
- Small knife or multitool

## On the Trail

- **Start early.**  
  Mornings are cooler, and you’ll have time to reach camp before afternoon storms.

- **Pace yourself.**  
  Take steady, manageable steps. Stop briefly before you’re tired.

- **Eat and drink often.**  
  You’ll burn more water and calories than you realize. Replace electrolytes to avoid cramps and headaches.

- **Stay oriented.**  
  Know where you are and where you’re going at all times. Check the map often enough that you could navigate alone if separated.

- **Handle problems early.**  
  A small blister or damp shirt can turn into a bigger issue fast. Stop and fix it before continuing.

## At Camp

- **Pick a safe spot.**  
  Camp away from dead trees, steep slopes, and low areas that flood. Look for existing durable sites whenever possible.

- **Stay organized.**  
  Keep small items where you can find them in the dark. Hang or seal scented items away from your sleep area.

- **Stay dry and warm.**  
  Change into dry clothes at camp. Air out damp gear when the sun’s out.

- **Cook safely.**  
  Cook on stable ground and keep flames clear of shelters. Dispose of waste water 200 feet from water sources.

- **Protect your food.**  
  Use a bear canister or Ursack. Store it at least 100 feet from your sleeping area.

## Hygiene and Health

- **Wash or sanitize hands before eating.**  
  Most trail illness comes from poor hygiene, not bad water.

- **Bathroom basics.**  
  Dig catholes 6–8 inches deep, 200 feet from water, trail, and camp. Pack out all toilet paper.

- **Foot care.**  
  Wash or wipe feet daily, let them dry, and treat hot spots early.

- **Minor injuries.**  
  Clean small cuts and blisters with water or sanitizer, then cover with tape or a bandage.

- **Stay fueled and hydrated.**  
  Eat a full meal at camp and drink extra water in the evening to recover for the next day.

## Respect and Safety

- **Follow Leave No Trace principles.**  
  Pack out all trash, stay on durable surfaces, and keep campsites clean.

- **Respect others.**  
  Keep noise down, yield to uphill hikers, and communicate clearly with your group.

- **Respect wildlife.**  
  Never feed animals or leave food unattended. Store everything with a scent.

- **Fire and regulations.**  
  Follow local rules for fires, stoves, and bear storage. Carry any required permits.
