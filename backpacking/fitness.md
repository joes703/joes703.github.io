# Backpacking Fitness Plan

Backpacking means carrying your own body up and down mountains, often at higher elevations where the air is thinner. Adding a pack makes it even harder. The lighter the load you carry, the easier every mile feels. That load comes from two places: **your pack and your body**. While reducing pack weight helps, improving fitness and reaching a healthy body weight make an even bigger difference.

Backpacking in the mountains is more demanding than hiking at sea level. Long climbs, uneven trails, altitude, and pack weight all put extra stress on your body. Training ahead of time prepares you for:

- **Endurance**: hiking for hours at a steady pace without burning out  
- **Strength**: handling climbs, descents, and pack weight safely  
- **Resilience**: avoiding knee, ankle, and back pain on consecutive days  
- **Adaptation**: being ready for the mix of distance, elevation, and terrain you’ll face  

This plan focuses on a few simple habits: walking and hiking for endurance, strength training for legs and core, and gradually carrying more pack weight. Do these consistently and you’ll reach the trailhead fit.

## Goals
- Lose weight gradually if needed.  
- Build endurance for long hikes with elevation.  
- Strengthen legs and core to handle a pack.  
- Adapt to carrying pack weight.  

## Weekly Plan

### Walking / Hiking
- 150–300 minutes per week of brisk walking or hiking.  
- Start with 30 minutes, 4–5 days per week.  
- Progress to 60+ minutes, 5–6 days per week.  
- Add hills or stairs once a week.  
- Add a backpack gradually: start light (5–10 lbs), increase monthly toward trip weight.  

### Strength Training (2–3x per week)
- Squats – 3 sets of 10–15  
- Step-ups – 3 sets of 10 each leg  
- Lunges or split squats – 3 sets of 8–12 each leg  
- Glute bridges – 3 sets of 15  
- Plank or side plank – hold 30–60 seconds  

### Cardio Conditioning
- Once per week: brisk hill walk, stair climb, or incline treadmill for 20–40 minutes.  
- Optional second session: intervals (30s fast walk / 90s easy, repeat 8–12 times).  

### Mobility & Recovery
- 5–10 minutes stretching after walks (calves, hamstrings, hips).  
- Focus on ankle mobility and balance.  

## Monthly Progression
- Months 1–3: Build habit. Walk often, start light strength training, improve diet.  
- Months 4–6: Increase distance and time. Add hills and light pack weight.  
- Months 7–9: Hike once or twice a month with near full pack. Aim for 6–8 miles comfortably.  
- Months 10–12: Simulate trip. Back-to-back hiking days with close-to-trip pack weight.  

## Daily Habit Targets
- At least 30 minutes of movement every day.  
- Strength train 2–3 non-consecutive days per week.  
- 7,000–10,000 steps daily baseline.  
- Watch food portions for gradual weight loss.  

## If You Only Do Three Things
1. **Walk daily**, ramping up to an hour.  
2. **Strength train twice a week** (squats, step-ups, planks).  
3. **Do one weekly hike with a pack**, increasing distance and weight.
