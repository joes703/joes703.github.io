# BACKPACKING TRIP INFORMATION

**WELCOME**  
I’m glad you’re thinking about joining me on a backpacking trip. These trips are a chance to spend time in the wilderness and enjoy good company. This document explains what you need to know before coming along. Please read it in its entirety.

**GENERAL INFORMATION**  
Backpacking means hiking with all of your food, clothing, and shelter in your pack. Days are spent on the trail; evenings are spent camping near a lake, river, or creek. Each person sets up their own shelter, filters water, cooks simple meals, and sleeps outdoors. This is the baseline of what every trip involves.  

These backpacking trips are most often in the Sierra Nevada. The preferred season there is mid-July through September. Earlier in the summer, many trailheads are still closed by snow and mosquitoes are at their worst. After September, nights become very cold and early snow is possible.  

Trips are usually 2–4 nights, with daily mileage in the range of 6–10 miles. Expect elevation gain and loss, rocky trails, and travel between 7,000 and 10,500 feet. Weather in the mountains can change quickly: hot sun during the day, cold nights, sudden storms, and occasional snow at higher elevations.  

These trips require both planning and commitment well in advance. Wilderness permits are released six months before the trip and usually sell out quickly, so the route and group must be set early. Permits also place strict limits on group size, and larger groups are difficult to manage on the trail and at camp. Space is limited, so participation requires an early commitment.  

These are self-supported group trips. Everyone is expected to come fully prepared with the gear, food, and clothing they need for the conditions.  

After most trips we stop somewhere for hot showers and a meal before heading home. Bring clean clothes and a towel if you plan to do this.   

**COSTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES**  
- Permit fees are split equally.  
- Transportation is usually by carpool, with fuel costs shared. Volunteers are needed to drive.  
- Each participant is responsible for bringing their own food and gear. This means obtaining it in advance, making sure it works, and packing it.  
- Everyone must be self-sufficient and prepared for the conditions.  

**EXPECTATIONS**  
These trips work best when everyone follows the same standards. They exist to keep the group safe, respect the wilderness, and make the experience enjoyable.  

On the trail, the group stays together. Nobody hikes out of sight or falls behind alone. At trail junctions, everyone waits until the full group has arrived. The pace is moderate so that no one is left behind. Independence may be possible in certain situations, but only with clear agreement and acceptance of personal responsibility.  

At camp, sites are chosen according to regulations and Leave No Trace principles. Everyone is expected to be considerate of space, quiet, and the needs of others. Each person sets up their own shelter, prepares their own meals, and manages their own cleanup.  

Wilderness regulations must be followed at all times. Food storage rules are strict: most Sierra trips require bear canisters, and all scented items must be secured. Campfires are prohibited in many areas and often banned by elevation or seasonal fire restrictions.  

**LEAVE NO TRACE**  
These principles are the minimum responsibility we all share when traveling in the backcountry:  
1. Plan Ahead and Prepare — Know regulations, weather, and terrain. Prepare for emergencies. Avoid high-use times.  
2. Travel and Camp on Durable Surfaces — Stay on established trails. Camp on durable ground such as rock, gravel, or dry grasses, and avoid fragile areas. Set up camp at least 200 feet from lakes and streams unless regulations state otherwise.  
3. Dispose of Waste Properly — Pack out all trash. Use catholes (6–8 inches deep, 200 feet from water) for human waste unless wag bags are required. Pack out toilet paper.  
4. Leave What You Find — Do not disturb natural features or cultural artifacts. Leave plants, rocks, and other objects as you found them.  
5. Minimize Campfire Impacts — Follow all fire restrictions. Use a stove for cooking. Fires are prohibited in many high-altitude areas.  
6. Respect Wildlife — Observe from a distance. Never feed animals. Store food securely.  
7. Be Considerate of Others — Yield on trails, keep noise levels down, and respect the solitude of others.  

**HEALTH AND SAFETY**  
Do not join a trip if you are sick or unfit for the planned mileage or elevation.  

Each participant must carry the Ten Essentials: navigation, headlamp, sun protection, first aid, knife/repair kit, fire starter, shelter, extra food, extra water, and extra clothing. See [The Mountaineers – Ten Essentials](https://www.mountaineers.org/blog/what-are-the-ten-essentials) for details.  

If you have a medical condition that could affect your safety, please inform me discreetly before the trip. The group will always provide support in an emergency, but each person is expected to come prepared so that preventable problems don’t put themselves or others at risk.  

Most trips take place between 7,000 and 10,500 feet. High elevation affects people in different ways. Altitude sickness can cause shortness of breath, fatigue, headache, and nausea, even in otherwise healthy hikers. Be aware of the symptoms, pace yourself, stay hydrated, and communicate if you are not feeling well. Acclimatization helps; consider arriving a day early or doing shorter hikes first to adjust.  

**PREPARATION AND GEAR**  
New participants should also read [backpacking tips](tips.md). It covers food, water, clothing, and other practical details that are not repeated here.  

Physical preparation is required. Do some training hikes with a loaded pack before the trip so mileage and elevation feel manageable.  

Pack weight is one of the most important factors for comfort and safety. Heavy packs slow the group, increase the risk of injury, and can turn a trip into a struggle. Keep total weight as low as practical, ideally under 30 pounds including food and water. Use a luggage or bathroom scale to weigh your pack at home before the trip, and leave behind anything that isn’t necessary. Lightweight gear makes a difference, but smart choices matter just as much.  

Backpacking gear is not the same as camping gear. Tents, sleeping bags, and cookware designed for backpacking are much lighter and more compact than car-camping equipment. Do not bring heavy or oversized gear that isn’t meant to be carried for miles.  

Inspect and test all gear before the trip. Make sure your shelter sets up properly, your filter works, your stove and fuel are functional, and everything fits in your pack. Problems should be caught at home, not on the trail.  

For full details on what to bring and how to prepare, see the [sample checklist](checklist.md), [gear recommendations](gear.md), and [backpacking tips](tips.md).    

**DISCLAIMER AND RESPONSIBILITY**  
Backpacking in the wilderness carries inherent risks, including but not limited to injury, illness, and unpredictable environmental hazards. These trips are peer-organized and not professionally guided or insured.  

By participating, you acknowledge that you are voluntarily assuming these risks and are solely responsible for your own safety, preparation, decisions, and equipment. No participant is liable for accidents, injuries, or losses that may occur to others.  

You must come fully prepared with the gear, food, and clothing you need and be capable of the planned mileage. The group looks out for one another, but no one else is responsible for carrying you through the trip.  

By joining a trip, you confirm that you have read and understood these expectations and that you accept full responsibility for your own safety, gear, and readiness.
