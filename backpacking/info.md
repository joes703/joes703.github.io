# Backpacking Trip Information

## Welcome
I’m glad you’re thinking about joining me on a backpacking trip. These trips are a chance to spend time in the wilderness and enjoy good company. This document explains what you need to know before coming along. Please read it in its entirety.

But first...backpacking is hard work. It’s long climbs, heavy packs, heat, bugs, and weather that doesn’t care about your plans. But it’s also quiet mornings, clear lakes, and the satisfaction of earning every view. Go because you find that kind of work rewarding, not just because friends are going or it sounds fun. When you know why you’re out there, the effort feels worth it and every trip becomes more meaningful.

## Trip Overview
These backpacking trips are most often in the Sierra Nevada. The preferred season there is mid-July through September. Earlier in the summer, many trailheads are still closed by snow and mosquitoes are at their worst. After September, nights become very cold and early snow is possible.  

Trips are usually 2–4 nights, with daily mileage in the range of 6–10 miles. Expect elevation gain and loss, rocky trails, and travel between 7,000 and 10,500 feet. Weather in the mountains can change quickly: hot sun during the day, cold nights, sudden storms, and occasional snow at higher elevations.  

These trips require planning and commitment well in advance. Wilderness permits are released six months before the trip and usually sell out quickly, so the route and group must be set early. Permits also place strict limits on group size, and larger groups are difficult to manage on the trail and at camp. Space is limited, so please confirm early if you plan to join.  

These are self-supported trips. Each hiker carries their own gear, food, and shelter for the duration of the trip.  

After most trips we grab showers and a meal before heading home. Bring clean clothes and a towel if you’d like to join.  

### Costs
- Permit fees are split equally.  
- Transportation is usually by carpool, with fuel costs shared. Volunteers are needed to drive.  

## Expectations
These trips run smoothly when everyone shares the same standards: being prepared, considerate, and aware. They exist to keep the group safe, respect the wilderness, and make the experience enjoyable.  

Everyone is responsible for bringing the right gear, food, and clothing for the conditions. Come prepared for the planned mileage and weather.  

On the trail, the group stays together. Nobody hikes out of sight or falls behind alone. At trail junctions, everyone waits until the full group has arrived. Separating may be possible in certain situations, but only with clear agreement and personal responsibility.  

We do our best to observe [Leave No Trace principles](https://lnt.org/why/7-principles/). This includes not polluting lakes and streams, keeping noise down, and cleaning up after ourselves.  

Wilderness regulations must be followed at all times. Food storage rules are strict: most Sierra trips require bear canisters, and all scented items must be secured. Campfires are prohibited in many areas and often banned by elevation or seasonal restrictions.  

## Health and Safety
You should not join a trip if you are sick or unfit for the planned mileage or elevation.  

If you have a medical condition that could affect your safety, please consider informing me discreetly before the trip. The group will always provide support in an emergency, but each person is expected to come prepared so that preventable problems don’t put themselves or others at risk.  

Most trips take place between 7,000 and 10,500 feet. High elevation affects people in different ways. Altitude sickness can cause shortness of breath, fatigue, headache, and nausea, even in otherwise healthy hikers. Be aware of the symptoms, pace yourself, stay hydrated, and communicate if you are not feeling well. Acclimatization helps; consider arriving a day early or doing shorter hikes first to adjust.  

## Disclaimer
Backpacking in the wilderness carries inherent risks, including but not limited to injury, illness, and unpredictable environmental hazards. These trips are peer-organized and not professionally guided or insured.  

By participating, you acknowledge that you are voluntarily assuming these risks and are responsible for your own safety, preparation, decisions, and equipment. No participant is liable for accidents, injuries, or losses that may occur to others.  

The group looks out for one another, but no one else is responsible for carrying you through the trip.  

By joining a trip, you confirm that you have read and understood these expectations and that you accept full responsibility for your own safety, gear, and readiness.
